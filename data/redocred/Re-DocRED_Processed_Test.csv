3,Bantustan,"A Bantustan (also known as Bantu homeland, black homeland, black state or simply homeland ;) was a territory set aside for black inhabitants of South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia), as part of the policy of apartheid. Ten Bantustans were established in South Africa, and then in neighbouring South West Africa (then under South African administration), for the purpose of concentrating the members of designated ethnic groups, thus making each of those territories ethnically homogeneous as the basis for creating "" autonomous "" nation states for South Africa's different black ethnic groups. The term was first used in the late 1940s and was coined from Bantu (meaning "" people "" in some of the Bantu languages) and -stan (a suffix meaning "" land "" in the Persian language and some Persian-influenced languages of western, central, and southern Asia). It was regarded as a disparaging term by some critics of the apartheid-era government's "" homelands "" (from Afrikaans tuisland). The word "" bantustan "", today, is often used in a pejorative sense when describing a region that lacks any real legitimacy, consists of several unconnected enclaves, or emerges from national or international gerrymandering. Four of the South African Bantustans  Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei (the so-called "" TBVC States"")were declared independent, but this was not recognised outside South Africa. Other South African Bantustans (like KwaZulu, Lebowa, and QwaQwa) received partial autonomy but were never granted independence. In South West Africa, Ovamboland, Kavangoland, and East Caprivi were granted self-determination. The Bantustans were abolished with the end of apartheid and re-joined South Africa proper in 1994.

4,Long Hard Road Out of Hell,""" Long Hard Road Out of Hell "" is a song by American rock band Marilyn Manson and British trip hop band Sneaker Pimps, released as a single from the soundtrack to the 1997 motion picture Spawn. An arena rock and gothic rock song, "" Long Hard Road Out of Hell "" was written by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez and produced by Manson and Sean Beavan. Its lyrics are about self-loathing and its title is derived from John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667). After the track was written, the Sneaker Pimps ' Kelli Ali was recruited to perform background vocals on it, as the Spawn soundtrack featured collaborations between hard rock artists and electronic music artists. The Sneaker Pimps were dissatisfied with the final track and wanted a remix of it to be released as a single instead ; conversely, Manson deemed it a personal favorite. "" Long Hard Road Out of Hell "" received mixed reviews from music critics ; some found it heartfelt while others felt it was too indistinct from other Marilyn Manson songs. Commentators noted that the track encapsulated the evolution of the band's sound from the industrial music of Antichrist Superstar (1996) to the glam rock of Mechanical Animals (1998). Manson initially approached Jonathan Glazer to direct the video for the track, but rejected his concept for it ; Glazer later used his concept for the video for Radiohead's "" Karma Police "" (1997). The music video for "" Long Hard Road Out of Hell "" was directed by Matthew Rolston. It depicts Manson in a dress and a group of models who initially appear to be female but are revealed to be male. The clip garnerd acclaim from critics for its imagery. ","Long Hard Road Out of Hell | producer | Marilyn Manson

6,Myra Clark Gaines,"Myra Clark Gaines (c. June 30, 1804January 9, 1885) was an American socialite and plaintiff in the longest-running lawsuit in the history of the United States court system. From 1834 to 1891, Gaines was at the center of a legal battle to recognize her legal status as the sole heir of her deceased father's estate and recover valuable land in New Orleans. During its 57-year history in the courtroom, the Gaines cases appeared before the Supreme Court seventeen times and Louisiana state and federal court at least seventy times. The Gaines cases are notable not only because of their length and complexity but also due to the controversial image and perseverance of Myra Clark Gaines herself, particularly at a time when women were confined to a domestic, dutiful ideal of femininity.

9,Jirō Shiizaki,"Jir Shiizaki (,Shiizaki Jir) (30 September 1911  15 August 1945) was a lieutenant colonel in the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II. He served as a member of the staff of the domestic affairs section of the Military Affairs Bureau's War Affairs Section. Shiizaki was one of several members of that staff to participate in a coup (the Kyj incident) in the early morning of August 15, 1945, the day the Emperor would declare Japan's surrender. The coup was organized primarily by Major Kenji Hatanaka, and though quite a number of men were involved in the plot at one point or another, Shiizaki was one of the few to be involved in the climactic action ; the rebels, with the help of the First Imperial Guard Division, seized the Imperial Palace, held Emperor Hirohito under, essentially, house arrest, and sought to destroy the phonographic recordings which had been made of the Emperor's surrender speech. Sometime around seven o'clock on the morning of August 15, the plot began to fall apart. General Shizuichi Tanaka, commander of the Eastern District Army, arrived at the Palace and harangued the conspirators on their duty to their country, and demanding that the dishonor brought by their treason could only be absolved through seppuku. Shiizaki, along with a number of others, committed ritual suicide that morning, on the grounds of the Imperial Palace. ","Jirō Shiizaki | conflict | World War II

PGC was established in the winter of 1914, when a group of nine businessmen assembled to form a new club after leaving their respective clubs.

11,Velislai biblia picta,"The Velislaus Bible or Velislav's Bible (Latin Velislai biblia picta) is an illuminated manuscript of 1325  1349, which is in effect a picture-book of the Bible, as the text is limited to brief titles or descriptions of the 747 pictures from the Old Testament and the New Testament, from the writings about the Antichrist and from the legends of the saints, especially St Wenceslas. It is therefore an example of a Biblia pauperum, though not in the typical form, having many more images. Most of the illuminations are only in ink, though some colour is used. The manuscript is of 188 folios on parchment, with a page size of 307 x 245 mm. It is in the Czech National Library (Nrodn knihovna Cesk republiky), Prague. The codex was created by several artists probably for Velislav the Canon (d. 1367), the notary of John I of Bohemia and his son Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, who were both based in Prague.

12,Emiliano Esono Michá,"Emiliano Esono Mich is an Equatoguinean political activist currently imprisoned on weapons possession charges. His imprisonment drew protest from the US State Department and Amnesty International, the latter of which named him a prisoner of conscience. Mich was active with the Progress Party of Equatorial Guinea (PPGE), a banned political party opposing the long-dominant Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea. In late March 2008, he was arrested without a warrant. Within a week, fellow PPGE activists Cruz Obiang Ebele, Gumersindo Ramrez Faustino, Juan Ecomo Ndong, Gerardo Ange Mangue, and Bonifacio Nguema Ndong were also arrested. Mich was held for two months at the police station, turning which time he was allegedly tortured. In May 2008, the six men were charged with knowledge of a weapons cache in the home of another PPGE activist, Saturnino Ncogo. Ncogo had died in prison on early March in suspicious circumstances. Authorities alleged he had thrown himself from the top bunk of his cell to commit suicide, but relatives received his body in an advanced state of decomposition, and no investigation was ever conducted. According to Amnesty International, the six men were given an unfair trial at which no evidence was presented save the weapons from Ncogo's home and the statements the six had made under duress ; in addition, the six defendants alleged that police had altered their statements after the defendants had signed them. Despite being charged with unrelated crimes, the six were tried alongside Simon Mann, a UK national who had helped to organize a 2004 coup attempt. The six PPGE members were given sentences of one to five years apiece. The US State Department considers Mich a political prisoner, and has objected to his continued imprisonment. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience, and has called for his immediate release. ","Emiliano Esono Michá | country of citizenship | Equatoguinean

14,Paradise Cracked,"Paradise Cracked () is a cyberpunk single-player turn-based strategy video game. It was created by MiST Land South (renamed as GFI Russia in 2006) for Microsoft Windows and released in 2002. It has several translation problems that make the game difficult to understand in English. The player starts as a character named "" Hacker "" who is just as the name implies. The player starts with a pistol and the ability to hack certain objects (ATM's, Trade Robots, etc.) as well as a journal which gives maps of the area and tells them missions both current and completed. As certain missions are completed, the character's level will increase and skills can have points added to them increasing areas like strength, aim, hacking skill, health points and so forth. The game offers the option to play solo or to join with other characters or groups (such as the mob). Hacker is constantly hunted by the law making teaming up with someone in the best interest of the player's survival. Teaming up will also add new missions to Hacker's journal. Additional weapons, items, and body armor can be acquired by purchase or by killing another player. The character's strength determines what weight of weapons, items etc. he can carry while certain clothing will increase or decrease the number of items they can carry. The heavier the weight, the less distance the character can move in a given turn. As strength and level increase, so will a character's distance he can travel. The game never really gained much ground in terms of commercial success. ","Paradise Cracked | publication date | 2002

24,Pangaea Ultima,"Pangaea Ultima (also called Pangaea Proxima, Neopangaea, and Pangaea II) is a possible future supercontinent configuration. Consistent with the supercontinent cycle, Pangaea Ultima could occur within the next 250 million years. This potential configuration, hypothesized by Christopher Scotese, earned its name from its similarity to the previous Pangaea supercontinent. Scotese later renamed Pangaea Ultima (Last Pangaea) to Pangaea Proxima (Next Pangaea) to alleviate confusion about the name Pangaea Ultima which could imply that it would be the last supercontinent. The concept was based on examination of past cycles of formation and breakup of supercontinents, not on current understanding of the mechanisms of tectonic change, which are too imprecise to project that far into the future. "" It's all pretty much fantasy to start with, "" Scotese has said. "" But it's a fun exercise to think about what might happen. And you can only do it if you have a really clear idea of why things happen in the first place. "" Supercontinents describe the merger of all, or nearly all, of the Earth's landmass into a single contiguous continent. In the Pangaea Ultima scenario, subduction at the western Atlantic, east of the Americas, leads to the subduction of the Atlantic mid-ocean ridge followed by subduction destroying the Atlantic and Indian basin, causing the Atlantic and Indian Oceans to close, bringing the Americas back together with Africa and Europe. As with most supercontinents, the interior of Pangaea Proxima would probably become a semi-arid desert prone to extreme temperatures. ","Earth | has part | Africa

26,The Time of the Doves,"The Time Of The Doves (also translated as The Pigeon Girl or In Diamond Square ; original Catalan-language : La plaa del Diamant, that is Diamond Square) is a 1962 novel written by exiled Catalan writer Merc Rodoreda. It is notable for its use of stream of consciousness. The book is named after a square in Barcelona's Grcia district. It is featured in Harold Bloom's The Western Canon as part of a list of canonical books of the "" Chaotic Age "". Arguably the author's most accomplished work, the novel has been translated into more than thirty languages and is regarded as one of the most important pieces of fiction in contemporary Catalan literature. It is also a staple of the curriculum in secondary school programs across Catalonia. Dealing with the Second Spanish Republic and the Spanish Civil War, the novel is set in Barcelona before, during and after the war and pictures a young woman's struggles in life as well as her conflictive relationships with two men, and her progression from nearly complete submission until she develops a full-fledged outlook in life, personal maturity and independence. It is also a faithful chronicle of life in the city at the time, in a balanced mixture of psychologism and naturalism. ","Mercè Rodoreda | languages spoken, written or signed | Catalonia

30,Amambanda,""" Amambanda "" was the Dutch entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, performed predominantly in an imaginary language but with some words in English by Treble. This was the second occasion on which a song had been performed with lyrics in an invented language-Belgium having entered Sanomi by Urban Trad at the 2003 Contest. The song is an up-tempo number, with many influences from African and flamenco music. The lyrics explain that "" There is a way / To understand without a language "", in keeping with the musical theme of exuberant joy in spite of an apparently insurmountable language barrier. The title was the cause of much confusion prior to the Contest, with the official CD of entries titling the track "" Amanbanda "" (with an "" n "" instead of an "" m ""). BBC commentary referred to the song as "" Amamdangda "" briefly, as well as describing the group as "" a mother and her two daughters "", which was also incorrect as Caroline Hoffman was not the mother of the two van Dijk sisters, though this comment was sarcastic and not taken as literal by listeners. As the Netherlands had not finished the 2005 Contest in the top 10, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed seventeenth, following Finland's Lordi with "" Hard Rock Hallelujah "" and preceding Lithuania's LT United with "" We Are The Winners "". At the close of voting, it had received 22 points, placing 20th in a field of 23 and thus missing out on the final and requiring the Netherlands to qualify from the semi-final at the next Contest. Immediately following this result, rumours began to circulate that the Netherlands would opt out of the next Contest. These rumours were, however, proven to be untrue as the country began qualification for the 2007 Contest. It was succeeded as Dutch representative at the 2007 Contest by Edsilia Rombley with "" On Top of the World "". ","Hard Rock Hallelujah | performer | Finland 's Lordi

34,Northern Territory Force,"Northern Territory Force was an Australian Army force responsible for protecting the Northern Territory during World War II. Most units assigned to the Northern Territory Force were based near Darwin and were responsible for defending the important naval and air bases in and around the town against a feared Japanese invasion. Northern Territory Force was briefly re-named the 12th Division in late 1942 but this was short-lived. Australian Army units were rotated through northern Australia during the war and six infantry brigades served as part of Northern Territory Force between 1942 and 1945. The formation was reduced over the course of the war as the strategic situation in the Pacific turned in the Allies ' favour, although remnants remained until the end of the war. In early 1946, it was converted back to the 7th Military District. ","Northern Territory Force | military branch | Australian Army

35,List of longest rivers of Canada,"Among the longest rivers of Canada are 47 streams of at least. In the case of some rivers such as the Columbia, the length listed in the table below is solely that of the main stem. In the case of others such as the Mackenzie, it is the combined lengths of the main stem and one or more upstream tributaries, as noted. Excluded from the list are rivers such as the Dauphin, a short connecting link between lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg, with main stems of or less. Also excluded are rivers such as the Mississippi, the main stems of which do not enter Canada even though some of their tributaries do. Nine rivers in this list cross international boundaries or form them. Four  the Yukon, Columbia, Porcupine, and Kootenay  begin in Canada and flow into the United States. Five  the Milk, Pend d'Oreille, Saint Lawrence, Red, and Saint John  begin in the United States and flow into Canada. Of these, the Milk and the Kootenay cross the international border twice, the Milk leaving and then re-entering the United States, the Kootenay leaving and then re-entering Canada. The drainage basins of these nine rivers extend into both countries ; in addition, the drainage basins of six others  the Fraser, Assiniboine, South Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan, Nelson, and Winnipeg  extend into the United States even though their main stems flow entirely within Canada. Sources report hydrological quantities with varied precision. Biologist and author Ruth Patrick, describing a table of high-discharge rivers, wrote that data on discharge, drainage area, and length varied widely among authors whose works she consulted. "" It seems, "" she said, "" that the wisest course is to regard data tables such as the present one as showing the general ranks of rivers, and not to place too much importance on minor (1020 %) differences in figures.

37,Adolfo Nicolás,"Adolfo Nicols Pachn (born 29 April 1936), is a Spanish priest of the Roman Catholic Church. He was the thirtieth Superior General of the Society of Jesus, the largest religious order in the Roman Catholic Church. Nicols, after consulting with Pope Francis, determined to resign after his 80th birthday, and initiated the process of calling a Jesuit General Congregation to elect his successor. Until the resignation of his predecessor, Peter Hans Kolvenbach, it was not the norm for a Jesuit Superior General to resign ; they, like the great majority of the Popes up until Benedict XVI, generally served until death. However, the Jesuit constitutions include provision for a resignation. In October 2016 the thirty-sixth General Congregation of the Society of Jesus appointed his successor, Arturo Sosa from Venezuela. ","Adolfo Nicolás Pachón | date of birth | 29 April 1936

38,Each Time You Break My Heart,""" Each Time You Break My Heart "" is a song recorded by British singer Nick Kamen, for his eponymous debut studio album (1987). It was released by Sire Records on 2 November 1986 as his debut single in 7-inch and 12-inch maxi formats. Kamen had gained popularity by starring in a 1985 Levi's television commercial, later deciding to delve into music business and signed a record deal with Sire. "" Each Time You Break My Heart "" was the lead single from his album, written and produced by Madonna and Stephen Bray. It was originally set to be included on Madonna's third studio album, True Blue (1986), but failed to make the final track list. Madonna also provided background vocals on the track. A promotional video to accompany the single was directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino. The synth-pop song was featured in Billboard magazine's "" New and Noteworthy "" single list, receiving comparison to songs by the Bee Gees. It was a commercial success, reaching the top ten of the record charts in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It attained Silver certification in France and the United Kingdom, and a remix of the track became a dance hit in the United States. ","Each Time You Break My Heart | performer | Nick Kamen

Assassin's Creed Unity received mixed reviews upon its release. Praise was directed towards its visuals, improved gameplay, customization options, multiplayer-oriented format, mission design, setting, characterization, and narrative.

40,Ulysses (novel),"Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce. It was first serialised in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922, Joyce's 40th birthday. It is considered to be one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called "" a demonstration and summation of the entire movement "". According to Declan Kiberd, "" Before Joyce, no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking "". Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day, 16 June 1904. Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus, the hero of Homer's epic poem the Odyssey, and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel, with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Leopold Bloom and Odysseus, Molly Bloom and Penelope, and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus, in addition to events and themes of the early 20th-century context of modernism, Dublin, and Ireland's relationship to Britain. The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature. Since its publication, the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny, ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921, to protracted textual "" Joyce Wars "". The novel's stream-of-consciousness technique, careful structuring, and experimental prose  replete with puns, parodies, and allusions  as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour, have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history ; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday.

41,Metacomet Ridge,"The Metacomet Ridge, Metacomet Ridge Mountains, or Metacomet Range of southern New England is a narrow and steep fault-block mountain ridge known for its extensive cliff faces, scenic vistas, microclimate ecosystems, and rare or endangered plants. The ridge is an important recreation resource located within of more than 1.5 million people, offering four long-distance hiking trails and over a dozen parks and recreation areas, including several historic sites. It has been the focus of ongoing conservation efforts because of its natural, historic, and recreational value, involving municipal, state, and national agencies and nearly two dozen non-profit organizations. The Metacomet Ridge extends from New Haven and Branford, Connecticut on Long Island Sound, through the Connecticut River Valley region of Massachusetts, to northern Franklin County, Massachusetts, short of the Vermont and New Hampshire borders for a distance of. It is geologically distinct from the nearby Appalachian Mountains and surrounding uplands, and is composed of volcanic basalt (also known as trap rock) and sedimentary rock in faulted and tilted layers many hundreds of feet thick. In most cases, the basalt layers are dominant, prevalent, and exposed. The ridge rises dramatically from much lower valley elevations, although only above sea level at its highest, with an average summit elevation of.

43,ITS launch vehicle,"The ITS launch vehicle was a 2016-2017 design for a privately funded orbital launch vehicle planned to be developed by SpaceX. Design work was discontinued in 2017 when development was shifted to a smaller version, now called BFR. The initial design objective of the ITS launch vehicle was to launch a variety of SpaceX Interplanetary Transport System missions to Mars and other destinations in the beyond-Earth-orbit portion of the Solar System. The first launch was not expected before the 2020s. The ITS launch vehicle was to be operated as a somewhat unusual two-stage rocket. Its first stage was to have been powered by 42 Raptor rocket engines  designed and manufactured by SpaceX  operating on densified (chilled near triple point) methane / oxygen, propellants that have not been widely used as rocket propellants in the past. Like the Falcon 9 orbital launch vehicle that preceded it, the ITS launch vehicle's first stage design was intended to be reusable, following a return to the launch site and vertical landing following each launch. When announced, it was also designed to have a new feature for SpaceX launch vehicles : full reusability of even the second-stage and orbital spacecraft as well. The large payload capacity of the launch vehicle placed it into the super-heavy lift class, with the ability to place into low Earth orbit in reusable configuration and in expendable mode. The second stage of the Earth launch vehicle was planned to have two versions, the Interplanetary spaceship for passengers and cargo and the ITS tanker to deliver propellants to Earth orbit. Both were to be powered by six vacuum-optimized Raptor rocket engines with three additional sea-level-nozzle Raptor engines for maneuvering. Thus, the element of the launch vehicle that was to provide second-stage acceleration to orbital velocity on all launches from Earth would also be used as an on-orbit spacecraft. The Interplanetary spaceship was planned as a very long-duration carrier of both passengers and space cargo to interplanetary destinations, and was to have served as both a descent and ascent vehicle at Mars. The high-level specifications for the vehicle were publicly announced in September 2016, but by July 2017, SpaceX had stated they would not build the -diameter vehicles as previously planned, but would instead build a "" still large "" but much smaller launch vehicle first. Subsequently, that was revealed to be the BFR in September 2017, a vehicle intended to cost-effectively replace and supersede all existing SpaceX launch vehicles and passenger / cargo spacecraft.

He was director of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office from 1965 through 1969, founder and later manager of Xerox PARC's Computer Science Laboratory from 1970 through 1983, and founder and manager of Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Center until 1996. Uniquely, Taylor had no formal academic training or research experience in computer science ; Severo Ornstein likened Taylor to a "" concert pianist without fingers, "" a perception reaffirmed by historian Leslie Berlin : "" Taylor could hear a faint melody in the distance, but he could not play it himself. He knew whether to move up or down the scale to approximate the sound, he could recognize when a note was wrong, but he needed someone else to make the music. "" His awards include the National Medal of Technology and Innovation and the Draper Prize. Taylor was known for his high-level vision : "" The Internet is not about technology ; it's about communication. The Internet connects people who have shared interests, ideas and needs, regardless of geography. "" ","Robert William Taylor | employer | ARPA

54,Conrad O. Johnson,"Conrad Oberon Johnson (November 15, 1915  February 3, 2008) was an American music educator, long associated with the city of Houston, who was inducted into the Texas Bandmasters Hall of Fame in 2000. Born in Victoria, Texas, Conrad Johnson was nine when his family moved to Houston. Following studies at Yates High School, he attended Houston College for Negroes and graduated from Wiley College. He was an active member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. He started his career in music education in 1941 and, following a thirty-seven-year career, retired from his position at Kashmere High School in 1978, but continued to remain active in shaping music in Houston by conducting summer programs and in-home tutoring. Johnson was a proficient musician in his own right and, at one point, played with Count Basie. Erskine Hawkins tried to convince him to join his orchestra, but Johnson declined, citing a love of teaching and obligations to his family. Later, Johnson made his lasting contribution to music by forming the Kashmere Stage Band, a renowned school orchestra that won a number of awards during its decade-long run. The Conrad O. Johnson School of Fine Arts at Kashmere High School is named after him. Conrad O. Johnson died in Houston days after his former students staged a celebration in his honor. The gala Saturday night concert, which was filmed by a documentary crew, was described by the students as "" the greatest 92nd birthday gift that he could have ever requested.

55,Consort Mei,"Consort Mei (died 755) was an imperial consort of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. She was one of Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine, often known as Mei fei (with fei being a standard rank for imperial consorts during her lifetime). Her actual name was Jiang Caipin (), originally called Consort Jiang. After being told by her that she greatly favored Plum-Blossom flowers (the flower is pronounced as mei in Chinese), Emperor Xuanzong began to fondly address her as Consort Mei. Consort Mei was initially selected by Gao Lishi, an eunuch official of Emperor Xuanzong, to become one of Emperor Xuanzong's concubines in his harem. As Consort Mei was the most literate and talented concubines, she soon obtained Xuanzong's favors. To express the favors towards Consort Mei, Xuanzong commanded servants to plant Plum-Blossom trees all around her palace to please her interest. Xuanzong even lovingly complimented her beauty as more adorable than Zhao Feiyan, and swore that he would never change his heart for her. However, in 737, after the death of Consort Wu, another favorite concubine of Xuanzong, Xuanzong was deeply depressed until Gao Lishi convinced him to try looking at Yang Yuhuan-the wife of prince Li Mao, Xuanzong son with Consort Wu since her beauty was described as the most "" irresistible "". Being curious, Xuanzong ordered Yang Yuhuan to come and subsequently fell in love with her beauty. Since Yuhuan was still literally his daughter-in-law (as she was Li Mao's wife), emperor Xuanzong then stealthily arranged Yuhuan to become a Taoist nun, after a brief moment, Xuanzong eventually offered Yuhuan honorable title as Yang Guifei (with Guifei being the highest rank for imperial consorts) after bestowing his son Li Mao a new wife. Yuhuan became Xuanzong's most beloved consort as Xuanzong soon forgot about Consort Wu's death. His favors towards Consort Mei also waned. In 755, An Lushan began to create a rebellion (known as An Lushan Rebellion) in the palace. Emperor Xuanzong decided to bring Yang Guifei and his cortege along to flee from the capital Chang'an to Chengdu. Consort Mei was left behind then murdered during the rebellion.

56,Operator Toll Dialing,"Operator Toll Dialing was a project and method used by the Bell System in the USA and Canada to automate the switching and billing of long distance calls in the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The program was initiated by 1945, at which time ca. 5 % of the 2.7 million toll board calls per day were handled by this method. Operator Toll Dialing eliminated the need for intermediate and inward operators to complete toll calls to distant central offices. Initially this system involved step-by-step routings to set up each circuit, but later was improved by the development of area codes with machine translation which helped to standardize dialing across the network. The system was implemented in the USA beginning in 1946. In 1947, the North American Numbering Plan for area codes was set up. Operator Toll DIaling was gradually superseded by Direct Distance Dialing (DDD), in which the customer dialed the area code as well as the number. Beginning in 1951 on a limited basis, it was not fully implemented until the 1970s. Telephone administrations in other countries implemented similar programs, such as in the United Kingdom, which led to Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD). ","Bell System | country | USA

57,Intelligent design,"Intelligent design (ID) is a pseudoscientific argument for the existence of God, presented by its proponents as "" an evidence-based scientific theory about life's origins "". Proponents claim that "" certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection. "" ID is a form of creationism that lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses, so it is not science. The leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute, a fundamentalist Christian and politically conservative think tank based in the United States. Though the phrase "" intelligent design "" had featured previously in theological discussions of the design argument, the first publication of the term intelligent design in its present use as an alternative term for creationism was in Of Pandas and People, a 1989 creationist textbook intended for high school biology classes. The term was substituted into drafts of the book, directly replacing references to creation science and creationism, after the 1987 United States Supreme Court's Edwards v. Aguillard decision, which barred the teaching of creation science in public schools on constitutional grounds. From the mid-1990s, the intelligent design movement (IDM), supported by the Discovery Institute, advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula. This led to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial in which U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III found that intelligent design was not science, that it "" can not uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents, "" and that the school district's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. ID presents two main arguments against evolutionary explanations : irreducible complexity and specified complexity. These arguments assert that certain features (biological and informational, respectively) are too complex to be the result of natural processes. As a positive argument against evolution, ID proposes an analogy between natural systems and human artifacts, a version of the theological argument from design for the existence of God. ID proponents then conclude by analogy that the complex features, as defined by ID, are evidence of design. Detailed scientific examination has rebutted the claims that evolutionary explanations are inadequate, and this premise of intelligent design  that evidence against evolution constitutes evidence for design  is a false dichotomy. It is asserted that ID challenges the methodological naturalism inherent in modern science though proponents concede that they have yet to produce a scientific theory.

60,Booker T. Washington,"Booker Taliaferro Washington ( November 14, 1915) was an American educator, author, orator, and advisor to presidents of the United States. Between 1890 and 1915, Washington was the dominant leader in the African-American community. Washington was from the last generation of black American leaders born into slavery and became the leading voice of the former slaves and their descendants. They were newly oppressed in the South by disenfranchisement and the Jim Crow discriminatory laws enacted in the post-Reconstruction Southern states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Washington was a key proponent of African-American businesses and one of the founders of the National Negro Business League. His base was the Tuskegee Institute, a historically black college in Alabama. As lynchings in the South reached a peak in 1895, Washington gave a speech, known as the "" Atlanta compromise "", which brought him national fame. He called for black progress through education and entrepreneurship, rather than trying to challenge directly the Jim Crow segregation and the disenfranchisement of black voters in the South. Washington mobilized a nationwide coalition of middle-class blacks, church leaders, and white philanthropists and politicians, with a long-term goal of building the community's economic strength and pride by a focus on self-help and schooling. But, secretly, he also supported court challenges to segregation and restrictions on voter registration, passing on funds to the NAACP for this purpose. Black militants in the North, led by W.  E.  B. Du Bois, at first supported the Atlanta compromise but after 1909, they set up the NAACP to work for political change. They tried with limited success to challenge Washington's political machine for leadership in the black community but also built wider networks among white allies in the North. Decades after Washington's death in 1915, the civil rights movement of the 1950s took a more active and militant approach, which was also based on new grassroots organizations based in the South, such as CORE, SNCC and SCLC. Booker T. Washington mastered the nuances of the political arena in the late 19th century, which enabled him to manipulate the media, raise money, develop strategy, network, push, reward friends, and distribute funds, while punishing those who opposed his plans for uplifting blacks. His long-term goal was to end the disenfranchisement of the vast majority of African Americans, who then still lived in the South. ","NAACP | inception | 1909

63,Auguste Dreyfus,"Auguste Dreyfus (28 June 1827  25 May 1897) was a French businessman who made his fortune by financing the Peruvian trade in guano. Dreyfus joined a small textile trading firm set up by three of his elder brothers and moved to Lima, Peru to act as their local representative. He became involved in the guano trade, and in 1869 signed a major contract with the Peruvian government that gave him a monopoly over exports of Peruvian guano to Europe. With this he controlled the largest source of Peruvian national income. The Peruvian government let Dreyfus act as their agent in managing their existing debt and floating new loans used for railway construction. The government ran into increasing financial difficulties. These were compounded by a war with Chile between 1879 and 1883 in which they lost their key guano-producing province. A lengthy series of lawsuits followed between the creditors whose loans were secured by guano deposits and the governments of Peru and Chile. The Dreyfus trading enterprise came to an end. He retired to France, where he owned a chateau in the country and a mansion in Paris that he filled with a major collection of art. ","Auguste Dreyfus | country of citizenship | France

64,Henri Guédon,"Henri Gudon (born May 22, 1944 in Fort de France in Martinique-died on February 12, 2006 in Paris, France after heart surgery) was a French percussionist from Martinique. His first band was called La Contesta and he organised it when he was 20. He was awarded a Maracas d'or the first year the awards ran. In 1983, Philippe Langlais invited him to compose a mix of classical and jazz with his orchestra, the resulting composition called Opra Triangulaire. He was a judo champion 1963-65. Multiple albums fused Antillean rhythms with other music from around the world. Guedon was instrumental in exporting the new sound of 60s and 70s Latin -guaguanco, boogaloo, salsa, descarga-to France and the rest of Europe. When Guedon began placing his percussion instruments at the front of the stage in the style of his great influence Ray Barretto, French audience members found themselves shocked and intrigued. Soon enough, greats like El Conde and Pacheco were touring France. Were it not for Henri Guedon, Europe could have conceivably taken years to move forward from mambo and cha-cha-cha.

69,The Answer Is Never,"The Answer is Never is the second full-length album recorded by the band Howards Alias. The album was released by Household Name Records on June 7, 2004 on compact disc. A huge leap in terms of quality of both songwriting and production in comparison to debut The Chameleon Script, this was the sound of a much more mature and less ska punk-influenced Howards Alias. As the band had become a quartet by this point, it was up to the multi-talented Nicholas Horne to play both trumpet and trombone during the recording process. This added a subtle irony to the fact that the album was touted as being ' closer to the live sound of Howards Alias ', as did the inclusion of a string instrument section on certain songs. Clocking in at just over an hour in length, The Answer is Never is commonly regarded as Howards Alias ' best altogether album. The album artwork was provided by UK comic book artist, Chronic Fatigue.

74,Rhodesian Bush War,"The Rhodesian Bush War  also called the Second Chimurenga and the Zimbabwe War of Liberation  was a civil conflict from July 1964 to December 1979 in the unrecognised country of Rhodesia (later Zimbabwe-Rhodesia). The conflict pitted three forces against one another : the Rhodesian government, led by Ian Smith (later the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian government of Bishop Abel Muzorewa) ; the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army, the military wing of Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union ; and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army of Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union. The war and its subsequent Internal Settlement, signed in 1978 by Smith and Muzorewa, led to the implementation of universal suffrage in June 1979 and the end of white minority rule in Rhodesia, which was renamed Zimbabwe Rhodesia under a black majority government. However, this new order failed to win international recognition and the war continued. Neither side achieved a military victory and a compromise was later reached. Negotiations between the government of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, the UK Government and Mugabe and Nkomo's united "" Patriotic Front "" took place at Lancaster House, London in December 1979, and the Lancaster House Agreement was signed. The country returned temporarily to British control and new elections were held under British and Commonwealth supervision in March 1980. ZANU won the election and Mugabe became the first Prime Minister of Zimbabwe on 18 April 1980, when the country achieved internationally recognised independence.

76,Google Chrome,"Google Chrome (commonly known simply as Chrome) is a freeware web browser developed by Google LLC. It was first released on September 2, 2008 for Microsoft Windows, and was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS and Android. Google Chrome is also the main component of Chrome OS, where it serves as a platform for running web apps. Google releases the majority of Chrome's source code as the Chromium open-source project ; however, Chrome itself is proprietary software. One component that is not open-source is the built-in Adobe Flash Player (that Chrome has disabled by default since September 2016). Chrome used the WebKit layout engine until version 27. As of version 28, all Chrome ports except the iOS port use Blink, a fork of the WebKit engine. , StatCounter estimates that Google Chrome has a 68 % worldwide usage share of web browsers as a desktop browser. It also has 61 % market share across all platforms combined, because it has over 50 % share on smartphones ; and thus Chrome is the most used browser in virtually all countries (most exceptions in Africa). Its success has led to Google expanding the "" Chrome "" brand name on various other products such as Chrome OS, Chromecast, Chromebook, Chromebit, Chromebox and Chromebase.

It took place on the 26th day of the 4th month of the Keich era. As the Shgun's Eastern Army prepared to renew, the siege begun the previous winter, the saka garrison sallied forth, ambushing Tokugawa forces in a number of skirmishes and sieges. In the battle of Kashii, a contingent of forces loyal to Toyotomi Hideyori, lord of saka, attempted to besiege Wakayama Castle, which was controlled by Asano Nagaakira, an ally of the shgun. The attackers were led by no Harunaga, Hanawa Naoyuki, and Okabe Noritsuna.

80,Berge Meere und Giganten,"Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 science fiction novel by German author Alfred Dblin. Stylistically and structurally experimental, the novel follows the development of human society into the 27th century and depicts global-scale conflicts between future polities, technologies, and natural forces, culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland's ice cap. Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has the reputation of being a difficult and polarizing novel, and has not received nearly as much attention as Dblin's following novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929). Inspired by the mundane sight of pebbles rolling in the Baltic Sea surf in the summer of 1921, Dblin began writing Berge Meere und Giganten that fall, conducting extensive research into various natural and human sciences in the process. Although he had originally conceived of it as a hymn to the city and technology, over the course of writing the novel it evolved into a tribute to the power of nature. He finished the manuscript in the summer of 1923, and it was published by Fischer Verlag the following year. ","Alfred Döblin | notable work | Berge Meere und Giganten

82,Ten Commandments for Drivers,"On June 19, 2007, the Vatican, under the direction of Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Renato Martino, issued a 36-page document entitled Guidelines for the Pastoral Care of the Road, created by the curial Pontifical Council for Migrants and Itinerant People, under the leadership of Renato Raffaele Cardinal Martino, and intended for bishop conferences around the world. The document specifically states that it is aimed at bishops, priests, religious and other pastoral workers in hopes of pastoral caregivers paying greater attention to expressions of human mobility. The document derived some of its material from the Old Testament, the New Testament, the American Automobile Association, and statements by Popes Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI and John Paul II. On its issue this document received a lot of media attention due to its listing of Ten Commandments for Drivers. In essence, the Vatican is pointing out that the act of driving has a moral and ethical component. The Guidelines make note of both the benefits of the use of automobiles as well as its dangerous and negative consequences. The problem is not as pervasive in the Vatican City itself, which has a speed limit of 30  km / h (18-19  mph) and approximately only 1000 cars ; but there were over 35 million deaths resulting from car accidents in the 20th century, and the Vatican is responding. In the same section of the document as the Drivers ' Ten Commandments are the so-called Christian virtues of drivers, which include prudence, justice and hope. The Guidelines not only deal with problems on the road, but also address prostitution, caring for street children and the homeless, found in Parts Two, Three and Four of the Guidelines. The Guidelines state that driving can bring out primitive behavior in drivers, which leads to road rage, rude gestures, speeding, drinking behind the wheel, cursing, blasphemy, impoliteness, and intentional violation of the highway code. The Guidelines encourage drivers to obey the highway code, pray behind the wheel and recite the rosary, which the Guidelines insist would not distract the driver's attention.

83,Lavaca Bay,"Lavaca Bay () is a northwestern extension of the Matagorda Bay system found mostly in Calhoun County, Texas, United States. The ports of Port Lavaca and Point Comfort have been established on the bay, and are the main areas of human habitation. Linnville was located on the bay until its abandonment after the Great Raid of 1840, and the major port of Indianola was found near the confluence with the main Matagorda Bay, until the town's final destruction following the massive hurricane of 1886. Smaller communities include Olivia, Alamo Beach and Magnolia Beach. Lavaca Bay is approximately northeast of Corpus Christi, about southwest of Houston, and southeast of San Antonio. The bay is noted for its superfund site, caused by mercury pollution from the heavy industry in Point Comfort (specifically Alcoa), across the bay from the largest settlement of Port Lavaca. Although fishing has declined in recent years due to fears of contamination, the bay supports a large finfish population, and the efforts of environmental organizations and the federal government have pressured Alcoa to reduce the polluted areas.

84,The Horn Blows at Midnight,"The Horn Blows at Midnight (1945) is a comedy fantasy film directed by Raoul Walsh, and starring Jack Benny. Its biggest claim to fame, apart from its star, is its failure at the box office. In the two decades following its release, Benny often exploited the film's failure for laughs in his popular radio and television comedy series The Jack Benny Program, making the film a well-known entity to his wide audience, even if they had never seen it. The Horn Blows At Midnight would prove to be Benny's final starring feature, although he would continue as a radio and TV star (as well as making cameo appearances in films) for years afterwards. The Horn Blows At Midnight had the misfortune to be released only eight days after the death of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This may have contributed to its poor reception, although the film's negative reviews (often alluded in jokes mentioning the production) might have also impacted it, as the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel, also dealing with the afterlife, opened on Broadway at roughly the same time and became a hit.

86,Blue River (Colorado),"The Blue River is a tributary of the Colorado River, approximately long, in the U.S. state of Colorado. It rises in southern Summit County, on the western side of the continental divide in the Ten Mile Range, near Quandary Peak. It flows north past Blue River and Breckenridge, then through the Dillon Reservoir near Dillon. The West portal for the "" Roberts Tunnel "" is at the base of Dillon Reservoir.

93,Il Gobbo di Rialto,"Il Gobbo di Rialto or the Hunchback of the Rialto is a granite statue of a hunchback found opposite the Church of San Giacomo di Rialto at the end of the Rialto in Venice. Sculpted by Pietro da Sal in the 16th century, the statue takes the form of a crouching, naked hunchback supporting a small flight of steps. According to the writings of Stefano Magno it was unveiled on 16 November 1541 and was used as a podium for official proclamations : the statutes of Venice or the names of offenders would be proclaimed by an official standing on the block at the same time as they were read out at Pietra del Bando near Piazza San Marco. It was also used as the finishing point for a punishment for minor misdemeanours ; the guilty party would be stripped naked and made to run the gauntlet of citizens lining the streets from Piazza San Marco to the Rialto, saving themselves further humiliation by kissing the statue. By the 19th century, time had taken its toll on the statue and, in 1836, it was restored with funds provided by the civic authorities. The block above the hunchback's head now bears a Latin inscription with the date of the restoration. It is said to communicate with the Pasquino, one of the talking statues of Rome. From the early 16th century the Pasquino, a statue of a torso, was used as an agent for critical commentaries against the Pope and the authorities : satirical notes would be attached anonymously to the base of the statue purporting to come from the Pasquino himself. Other statues in Rome would be used to fulfill a similar purpose and establish a dialogue. In the 17th century the Pasquino exchanged correspondence with Il Gobbo concerning the Republic of Venice, Pope Paul V and the writings of Cardinals Baronio and Bellarmino. The characters of Launcelot Gobbo and his father, Old Gobbo, in William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice may have been inspired by this traditional symbol of the Rialto.

97,Teardrops (George Harrison song),""" Teardrops "" is a song by English rock musician George Harrison from his 1981 album Somewhere in England. It was also issued as the second single off the album, in July 1981. As with the lead single, "" All Those Years Ago "", Harrison completed the song after Warner Bros. Records had rejected his initial submission of Somewhere in England in September 1980. In response to Warner's concerns, he wrote "" Teardrops "" as an attempt at a commercially oriented song. Harrison recorded the song at his Friar Park studio in England with Ray Cooper as his co-producer. Despite some reviewers predicting it as a hit, the single failed to achieve commercial success. In the United States, it peaked at number 102 on Billboards Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart and number 88 on the Cash Box Top 100. ","George Harrison | record label | Warner Bros. Records

98,March of the Volunteers,"The "" March of the Volunteers "" is the national anthem of the People's Republic of China, including its special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau. Unlike most previous Chinese state anthems, it is written entirely in the vernacular, rather than in Classical Chinese. Its lyrics were composed as a dramatic poem by the poet and playwright, the Japan-educated Tian Han in 1934 and set to music by Nie Er from Yunnan Province the next year for the film Children of Troubled Times. It was adopted as the PRC's provisional anthem in 1949 in place of the "" Three Principles of the People "" of the Republic of China and the Communist "" Internationale "". When Tian Han was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, the march was briefly and unofficially replaced by "" The East Is Red "", then played without words, then played with altered words. Restored to its original version, the "" March of the Volunteers "" was raised to official status in 1982, adopted by Hong Kong and Macau upon their restorations to China in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and included in the Chinese Constitution's Article 136 in 2004.

The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States drafted the work and all the Allies of World War II later confirmed it. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war : no territorial aggrandizement ; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people (self-determination) ; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it ; reduction of trade restrictions ; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all ; freedom from fear and want ; freedom of the seas ; and abandonment of the use of force, as well as disarmament of aggressor nations. Adherents of the Atlantic Charter signed the Declaration by United Nations on 1 January 1942, which became the basis for the modern United Nations. The Atlantic Charter set goals for the postwar world and inspired many of the international agreements that followed the war. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the postwar independence of European colonies, and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter. ","Atlantic Charter | inception | 14 August 1941

101,Political positions of Donald Trump,"The political positions of United States President Donald Trump (sometimes referred to as Trumpism) have elements from across the political spectrum. Trump has proposed sizable income tax cuts and deregulation consistent with conservative (Republican Party) policies, along with significant infrastructure investment and protection for entitlements for the elderly, typically considered liberal (Democratic Party) policies. His anti-globalization policies of trade protectionism and immigration reduction cross party lines. Trump has said that he is "" totally flexible on very, very many issues. "" Trump's signature issue is immigration, especially illegal immigration, and in particular building or expanding a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. As of October 2016, Trump's campaign had posted fourteen categories of policy proposals on his website, which have been since removed. During October 2016, Trump outlined a series of steps for his first 100 days in office. Trump's political positions, and his descriptions of his beliefs, have frequently changed. Politico has described his positions as "" eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory. "" According to an NBC News count, over the course of his campaign Trump made "" 141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues. "" Fact-checking organizations reported that during the campaign, Trump made a record number of false statements and lies compared to other candidates, a pattern that continued once in office.

102,Piracy on Falcon Lake,"Piracy on Falcon Lake refers to an increase in crime at the border between the United States and Mexico on Falcon Lake. The lake is a long reservoir of the Rio Grande that was constructed in 1954 and is a known drug smuggling route. A turf war between rival drug cartels for control of the lake began in March 2010 and has led to a series of armed robberies and shooting incidents. All of the attacks were credited to the Los Zetas cartel and occurred primarily on the Mexican side of the reservoir but within sight of the Texas coast. The so-called pirates operate "" fleets "" of small boats designed to seize fisherman and smuggle drugs. While the events have been referred to colloquially as piracy, all the waters of Falcon Lake are considered either US or Mexican territorial waters and therefore are not technically piracy under Article 101 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.

His first story appeared in 1903, but then the writer lapsed into a long pause before returning to writing in the early 1920s. His recalcitrance to the Soviet ideological pressure cost him life : he was executed during the Great Purge and his writings were banned for nearly twenty years. In the words of the modern British scholar of Russian and Georgian literature, Donald Rayfield, "" his vivid story-telling, straight in medias res, his buoyant humour, subtle irony, and moral courage merit comparison with those of Stendhal, Guy de Maupassant, and mile Zola. In modern Georgian prose only Konstantine Gamsakhurdia could aspire to the same international level. "" ","Mikheil Javakhishvili | date of birth | 8 November 1880

A. Henckels, Bker, Clauberg, Eickhorn, Carl Schmidt Sohn, and numerous other manufacturers. In Medieval times, the swordsmiths of Solingen coined the town's image, which is preserved to this date. In the latter part of the 17th century, a group of swordsmiths from Solingen broke their guild oaths by taking their sword-making secrets with them to Shotley Bridge, County Durham in England.

106,"Lemany, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship","Lemany () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Szczytno, within Szczytno County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It lies approximately north-east of Szczytno and south-east of the regional capital Olsztyn. Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (East Prussia). In the East Prussian plebiscite of 1920, which was largely boycotted by ethnic Poles, the inhabitants voted to remain in Germany by a count of 198-0. After World War II the region was placed under Polish administration by the Potsdam Agreement under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union. Most Germans fled or were expelled and replaced with Poles expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union or Ukrainians forced to settle in the area through Operation Vistula in 1947.

It first appeared in short story form as the cover article for the January 1994 issue of Wired magazine and was subsequently expanded to full novel length. Set in the early 1990s, it captures the state of the technology industry before Windows 95, and anticipates the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. The novel is presented in the form of diary entries maintained on a PowerBook by the narrator, Daniel. Because of this, as well as its formatting and usage of emoticons, this novel is similar to what emerged a decade later as the blog format. Coupland revisited many of the ideas in Microserfs in his 2006 novel JPod, which has been labeled "" Microserfs for the Google generation "". ","Douglas Coupland | notable work | JPod

117,Cesare Mori,"Cesare Mori (Pavia, December 22, 1871  Udine, July 6, 1942) was a prefect (prefetto) before and during the Fascist period in Italy. He is known in Italy as the "" Iron Prefect "" (Prefetto di Ferro) because of his iron-fisted campaigns against the Mafia in Sicily in the second half of the 1920s. He is widely regarded as a fascist, even though at the beginning of Italy's fascist dictatorship he arrested both fascists and socialists when he was prefect of Bologna. He officially joined the Fascist National Party only in 1926. He was probably an officer who did n't have any strong political beliefs and who exhibited courage, dedication and integrity in the defense of the state and its institutions especially in combating the Mafia in Sicily. Nonetheless, the fight against the Mafia carried out by Cesare Mori proved to be effective mainly due to the special powers granted to him by Benito Mussolini when he was prefect in Sicily. Italian film director Pasquale Squitieri made a movie in 1977 --- Il prefetto di ferro --- about his fight against the Mafia when he was prefect in Sicily.

118,"Heinrich LXXII, Prince Reuss of Lobenstein and Ebersdorf","Heinrich LXXII, Prince Reuss of Lobenstein and Ebersdorf (27 March 179717 February 1853) was the ruling prince of Reuss-Lobenstein from 7 May 1824 until his abdication on 1 October 1848, and of Reuss-Ebersdorf from 1822 to 1848. Unlike with most European monarchies, his large regnal number does not indicate that he was preceded by seventy-one previous rulers also named Heinrich. By tradition, all male members of the House of Reuss are named Heinrich, and are numbered by order of birth within the family in general. In the Reuss Younger Line, the numbering system was reset at the beginning of each century ; thus Heinrich LXXII's high number is directly related to his having been born at the very end of the eighteenth century. Heinrich LXXII abdicated in 1848, due to civil unrest in connection with the revolutions that spread through Germany and elsewhere in Europe that year. The last of his branch of the family, his principality passed to the Prince Reuss zu Schleiz, unifying the lands of the Reuss Younger Line.

123,Oliver &amp; Company,"Oliver & Company is a 1988 American animated musical comedy-drama film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released on November 18, 1988, by Walt Disney Pictures. The 27th Disney animated feature film, the film is based on the classic Charles Dickens novel Oliver Twist, which has been adapted many other times for the screen. In the film, Oliver is a homeless kitten who joins a gang of dogs to survive in the streets. Among other changes, the setting of the film was relocated from 19th century London to modern-day New York City, Fagin's gang is made up of dogs (one of which is Dodger), and Sykes is a loan shark. Following the release of The Black Cauldron, Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg held a pitch meeting with the animation staff, in which story artist Pete Young pitched the idea to adapt Oliver Twist with dogs. The pitch was quickly approved, and the film quickly went into production under the working title Oliver and the Dodger. Released on the same day as The Land Before Time, Oliver & Company was a box office success, but it received mixed reviews from film critics. The film was re-released in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom on March 29, 1996. It was then released on home video later that same year, and again in 2002 and 2009 on DVD. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in 2013, commemorating its 25th Anniversary. ","Walt Disney Feature Animation | owned by | Disney

128,Ålgård Line,"The lgrd Line () is a closed, but not abandoned, railway line between Ganddal and lgrd in Rogaland, Norway. The line was built as a narrow gauge branch line of the Jren Line by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and opened in 1924. It runs through the villages of Foss-Eikeland and Figgjo in Sandnes to lgrd in Gjesdal. Several proposals were made for the lgrd Line to become the first part of the main line from Stavanger to Oslo, but instead the Srlandet Line was connected to the Jren Line in 1944. At the same time, the lgrd Line was upgraded to standard gauge. The line had up to ten daily round trips with diesel multiple units, until passenger traffic was terminated in 1955. Freight traffic remained until 1988, when most of the line was abandoned in 1988, although was used until 2001. The line is owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The station at Figgjo has been converted to a museum, and the section from there to lgrd is used for recreational draisines. There have been proposals to reopen the line either as part of the Jren Commuter Rail or the planned light rail for Greater Stavanger.

129,Solar Jetman,"Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship is a multi-directional shooter video game developed by Zippo Games and Rare and published by Tradewest. It was released in North America on 14 October 1990 and in Europe on 26 September 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game is the third instalment of the Jetman series and was later re-released by Nintendo for their NES-based PlayChoice-10 arcade system in the United States in 1990. In the game, series protagonist Jetman must manoeuvre his small craft through caverns of various planets whilst searching for pieces of the Golden Warpship. The game is presented in a horizontal side-view environment and has ranging gravitational pulls for each planet, which subjects Jetman's craft to various forms of inertia. Similar to its predecessors, Jetman must keep his craft topped up with fuel in order to progress through levels. The game was developed mostly by Mancunian developer Zippo Games under the name of Iota before being ordered to change the game into a Jetman title by Rare. Ports of the game for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Atari ST were completed but not released due to poor sales of the NES version. The game received mostly positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's presentation and graphics, however criticism was directed at the game's difficulty. It was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay. ","Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship | publisher | Tradewest

131,Brooks Pharmacy,"Brooks Pharmacy was a chain of more than 330 pharmacies located throughout New England and New York and has been a well-recognized name in the New England pharmacy industry for several decades. The corporate headquarters were located in Warwick, Rhode Island. During its heyday in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Brooks was one of the premier regional drug chains in the United States, and was the second largest drug chain in New England, maintaining an especially strong presence in the states of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. In 2002, Brooks was recipient of the 2002 Rex Awards Regional Chain of the Year. However, Brooks faced many difficulties between 2004 and 2006, as its parent company struggled unsuccessfully to integrate 1,500 Eckerd stores acquired from J.C. Penney with the existing Brooks network, resulting in a steady loss of market share and lagging same-store sales as CVS and Walgreens continued to expand and solidify their store base in the New England region. In 2007, Brooks Pharmacy officially announced the sale of the pharmacy to Rite-Aid Pharmacy. The Brooks trade name, long associated with New England drug retailing, was retired.

Lutsenko is a former Minister of Internal Affairs. He occupied this post in the two cabinets of Yulia Tymoshenko and in cabinets of Yuriy Yekhanurov, and Viktor Yanukovych. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is the Ukrainian police authority, and Lutsenko became the first civilian minister in February 2005.

On 13 December 2010 Lutsenko was charged with abuse of office and forgery by Prosecutor General of Ukraine Viktor Pshonka. On 27 February 2012 Lutsenko was sentenced to four years in jail for embezzlement and abuse of office. Lutsenko was held at the Lukyanivska Prison from 26 December 2010 until 7 April 2013 when he was released from prison because Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych pardoned him (among others) for health reasons. Both Lutsenko and his political allies regard his trial as an act of political persecution by the regime of Viktor Yanukovych.

138,Antisemitic canard,"Antisemitic canards are unfounded rumors or false allegations which are defamatory towards Judaism as a religion, or defamatory towards Jews as an ethnic or religious group. They often form part of broader theories of Jewish conspiracies. According to defense attorney Kenneth Stern, "" Historically, Jews have not fared well around conspiracy theories. Such ideas fuel anti-Semitism. The myths that all Jews are responsible for the death of Christ, or poisoned wells, or killed Christian children to bake matzos, or "" made up "" the Holocaust, or plot to control the world, do not succeed each other ; rather, the list of anti-Semitic canards gets longer. "" Some antisemitic canards date back to the birth of Christianity, while some conspiracy theories are more recent. Since at least the Middle Ages, antisemitism has featured elements of conspiracy theory. In medieval Europe it was widely believed that Jews poisoned wells, had been responsible for the death of Jesus, and ritually consumed the blood of Christians. The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence of notions that Jews and/or Freemasons were plotting to establish control over the world. Forged evidence has been presented to spread the notion that Jews were responsible for the propagation of Communism, the most notorious example being The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (1903). Such antisemitic conspiracy theories became central to the worldview of Adolf Hitler. Antisemitic theories persist today in notions concerning banking, Hollywood, the news media and a purported Zionist Occupation Government. Holocaust denial is also considered an antisemitic conspiracy theory because of its position that the Holocaust is a hoax designed to advance the interests of Jews and justify the creation of the State of Israel.

144,In a Silent Way,"In a Silent Way is a studio album by American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader Miles Davis, released on July 30, 1969, on Columbia Records. Produced by Teo Macero, the album was recorded in one session date on February 18, 1969, at CBS 30th Street Studio in New York City. Incorporating elements of classical sonata form, Macero edited and arranged Davis's recordings from the session to produce the album. Marking the beginning of his, In a Silent Way has been regarded by music writers as Davis's first fusion recording, following a stylistic shift toward the genre in his previous records and live performances. Upon its release, the album was met by controversy among music critics, particularly those of jazz and rock music, who were divided in their reaction to its experimental musical structure and Davis's electric approach. Since its initial reception, it has been regarded by fans and critics as one of Davis's greatest and most influential works. In 2001, Columbia Legacy and Sony Music released the three-disc box set The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions, which includes the original album, additional tracks, and the unedited recordings utilized for production purposes.

145,The Murders in the Rue Morgue,""" The Murders in the Rue Morgue "" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe published in Graham's Magazine in 1841. It has been recognized as the first modern detective story ; Poe referred to it as one of his "" tales of ratiocination "". C. Auguste Dupin is a man in Paris who solves the mystery of the brutal murder of two women. Numerous witnesses heard a suspect, though no one agrees on what language was spoken. At the murder scene, Dupin finds a hair that does not appear to be human. As the first fictional detective, Poe's Dupin displays many traits which became literary conventions in subsequent fictional detectives, including Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot. Many later characters, for example, follow Poe's model of the brilliant detective, his personal friend who serves as narrator, and the final revelation being presented before the reasoning that leads up to it. Dupin himself reappears in "" The Mystery of Marie Rogt "" and "" The Purloined Letter "". ","C. Auguste Dupin | present in work | The Purloined Letter

146,Imam khatib (Sunni Islam),"In Sunni Islam, an imam khatib (or just imam,) is a leader, often the leader of prayers in the masjid, and the Muslim community. This compound title is merely a common combination of two elementary offices : leader (imam) of the congregational prayer, which in larger mosques is performed at the times of all daily prayers ; and preacher (khatib) of the sermon or khutba at the required congregational prayer on Friday. Although either duty can be performed by anyone who is regarded as qualified by the congregation, at most well-established mosques imam khatib is a permanent (part-time or full-time) position. He may be elected by the local community, or appointed by an outside authority  e. g., the national government, or the waqf which sustains the mosque. There is no ordination as such ; the only requirement for appointment as an imam khatib is recognition as someone of sufficient learning and virtue to perform both duties on a regular basis, and to instruct the congregation in the basics of Islam. Similar to spiritual leaders, the imam khatib is the one who leads Islamic worship services. More often, the community turns to the mosque imam if they have a religious question. In smaller communities, an imam could also be the community leader. The term is not to be confused with the use of Imams of Shi'a Islam, where it has a meaning more central to belief, referring to main leaders of the Shi'a community. The term imam is also used for a recognized religious scholar or authority in Islam, often for the founding scholars of the four Sunni madhhabs, or schools of jurisprudence (fiqh). It may also refer to the Muslim scholars who created the analytical sciences related to Hadith or it may refer to the heads of the Prophet Muhammad's family in their generational times. In other words, Imam Ali, referring to Ali ibn Abi Talib, is a phrase commonly used by both Shi'a and Sunni Muslims, though with different connotations. Those who are considered imams in the context of scholarly authority by Sunni Muslims, are listed below : ","Islamic | religion | Islam

147,American Theocracy,"American Theocracy : The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion, Oil, and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century () is a 2005 political commentary book by American political writer Kevin Phillips. The book is a critique of the past forty years of the Republican coalition in United States politics. He "" presents a nightmarish vision of ideological extremism, catastrophic fiscal irresponsibility, rampant greed, and dangerous shortsightedness. "" Phillips points to three unifying themes holding this coalition together. First, its tie to oil and the role oil plays in American and world events. Second, to the coalition of social conservatives, Evangelicals and Pentecostals in this Republican coalition. Finally, he points to the "" debt culture "" of this coalition, and to a coming "" debt bubble "" related to the debt of the U.S. Government and U.S. consumers. He argues that similar issues have been prevalent in the past, when other world powers, such as the Roman Empire and the British Empire declined from their peaks and fell into disarray. While working as a strategist in the presidential campaign of Richard Nixon, Phillips wrote The Emerging Republican Majority. In that book, Phillips predicted the formation of this very coalition that he criticizes in his current book. In American Theocracy he admits that while these "" mutations, "" as he calls them, could have been predicted, he did not foresee the extent to which they would develop and dominate the coalition he helped put together. The last chapter of this book references his first work, and is called "" The Erring Republican Majority.

149,Scotch and soda (magic trick),"Scotch and Soda is a magic effect involving a copper coin and a silver coin which appear to transpose in the spectator's hands. The effect relies on simple gimmick and tricks can be performed with it that are self-working, requiring almost no skill. The trick is named after the cocktail Scotch and soda ; the copper coin represents the "" Scotch "" and the silver coin represents the "" soda "". The effect is usually performed as follows : The magician displays two coins of almost equal size, one copper and one silver. The silver coin is most often a U.S. half dollar and the copper coin is usually either an English penny or a Mexican centavo. The magician stacks the coins and places them into the spectator's hand. He then asks her to place her hands behind her back and put one coin in each hand, remarking that the silver coin is slightly larger than the copper coin, making them easy to tell apart. The magician asks to see the silver coin which the spectator produces. When the spectator opens her other hand, the copper coin has become a quarter. The copper coin can then be made to appear wherever the magician desires, such as in the spectator's pocket or under an object across the room. Scotch and Soda is a popular trick that can be purchased at magic stores. A number of books exclusively on the subject describe different effects that can be achieved with the Scotch and Soda gimmick. Gin and tonic is a version of the trick using a dime and a penny. Another more recent version is Captain & Coke 2.0 as released by the Blue Crown, it uses a US quarter and a US penny. The modern version that uses a 20 Centavo and a Kennedy half is often attributed to Richard Himber. In the early 1900s, America's oldest magic company, Martinka made a version that utilized a Barber half dollar and a large cent. ","Barber | country of citizenship | U.S.

151,Giuseppe Barattolo,"Giuseppe Barattolo (1882  1949) was an Italian lawyer, politician and film producer. In 1913, during the silent era, Barattolo founded Caesar Film. Caesar made a series of popular films, some of which starred Francesca Bertini. In 1919 he joined and became an influential figure at the conglomerate Unione Cinematografica Italiana which dominated Italian film production during the early 1920s, but this came to an end following the box office failure of Quo Vadis (1924). In the early 1930s he tried to re-establish Caesar Film as a serious force in Italian production, but this also failed. During the 1930s, Barattolo lobbied the Fascist government of Italy for aid to rebuild the Italian film industry. He was a strong supporter of the government's plans during the mid-1930s to invest large amounts of money constructing Cinecitt studios in Rome, and during the era he worked at the state-backed Scalera Film. Barattolo was instrumental in attempts to rebuild the Italian film industry in Venice during the Italian Social Republic. After the fall of Benito Mussolini Barattolo worked as an independent producer. ","Quo Vadis | production company | Unione Cinematografica Italiana

158,List of Major League Baseball first-round draft picks,"Major League Baseball (MLB) is the highest level of play in North American professional baseball, and is the organization that operates the National League and the American League. In 2000, the two leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities, and all of their rights and functions were consolidated in the commissioner's office. Since that time, MLB has operated as a single league, and constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States. It is composed of 30 teams. The First-Year Player Draft, also known as the Rule 4 Draft, is MLB primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams. The first draft took place in 1965 ; it was introduced to prevent richer teams from negotiating wealthier contracts with top-level prospects and therefore, monopolizing the player market. Originally, three drafts were held each year. The first draft took place in June and involved high-school graduates and college seniors who had just finished their seasons. The second draft took place in January for high school and college players who had graduated in December. The third draft took place in August and was for players who participated in American amateur summer leagues. The August draft was eliminated after two years, and the January draft lasted until 1986. The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings, with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick. In addition, teams that lost free agents in the previous off-season may be awarded "" compensatory "" picks. ","Major League Baseball | country | the United States

160,Live in New York (Laurie Anderson album),"Live in New York was a 2-CD live album released by performance artist Laurie Anderson on Nonesuch Records in 2002. It was her ninth album of new recordings released since 1982. The front cover of the CD has the title Live at Town Hall, New York City September 1920, 2001, however the official title of the album is just Live in New York. Recorded less than 10 days after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York City, the album was produced during a tour Anderson gave of the United States in which she performed a mixture of older pieces from earlier in her career and newer works, including songs from her then-recent album Life on a String, as well as earlier albums such as United States Live, Big Science, Bright Red, Home of the Brave and Strange Angels. Following so close to the attacks, Anderson makes several statements about them in her recognizable style. The performance is highlighted by a performance of "" O Superman, "" the song that launched Anderson to stardom in 1981 and that contains lyrics that can  in retrospect  be seen to relate to the terrorist attacks. One song, "" Progress "", is a retitled performance of the song "" The Dream Before "" which Anderson debuted in her 1986 short film What You Mean We ? and later featured on Strange Angels.

164,Paul R. Ehrlich,"Paul Ralph Ehrlich (born May 29, 1932) is an American biologist, best known for his warnings about the consequences of population growth and limited resources. He is the Bing Professor of Population Studies of the Department of Biology of Stanford University and president of Stanford's Center for Conservation Biology. Ehrlich became well known for his controversial 1968 book The Population Bomb, which asserted that the world's human population would soon increase to the point where mass starvation ensued. Among the solutions he suggested in that book was population control, to be used in his opinion if voluntary methods were to fail. Ehrlich has been criticized for his opinions ; for example, Ronald Bailey termed Ehrlich an "" irrepressible doomster "". However, Carl Haub observed that Ehrlich's warnings had encouraged governments to change their policies to avert disaster. Ehrlich has acknowledged that some of what he predicted has not occurred, but maintains that his predictions about disease and climate change were essentially correct, and that human overpopulation is a major problem.

In one of his last interviews he stated that he was saddened by the fact that The Godfather, a fiction he never liked, outshone the novel of his mother's honest immigrant struggle for respectability in America and her courage and filial love, as portrayed in The Fortunate Pilgrim, 1965. The Fortunate Pilgrim is the real birthplace of The Godfather. As Puzo says, the book's hero, Lucia Santa, is based on his own mother : "" Whenever the Godfather opened his mouth, in my own mind I heard the voice of my mother. I heard her wisdom, her ruthlessness, and her unconquerable love for her family and for life itself.  The Don's courage and loyalty came from her ; his humanity came from her  and so, I know now, without Lucia Santa, I could not have written The Godfather. "" ","Lucia Santa | author | Mario Puzo

173,Orange Grove affair,"The Orange Grove affair was a political scandal in Australia concerning the dealings of the New South Wales state Australian Labor Party government with multinational corporation The Westfield Group. It resulted from a court decision in 2004 to force the closure of the Orange Grove shopping centre after a zoning dispute, with the loss of approximately 200 jobs. Westfield, who owned a nearby shopping centre, had challenged the legitimacy of the Orange Grove centre, which was operating on land not zoned for this purpose. When the courts ruled in Westfield's favor, Liverpool City Council sought State Government approval for a retrospective rezoning, to validate its earlier decision to approve the shopping centre. The State Government declined to intervene, despite a planning report suggesting that course of action, and the retail component of the Orange Grove centre was forced to close. The bulky goods component of the centre remained open, as the centre was legally zoned for bulky goods sales. However, the state Opposition subsequently unearthed information about a meeting between Premier Bob Carr's chief of staff and a prominent Westfield employee, sparking allegations that interference from Westfield had played a role in the government's decision not to intervene. As a result, a parliamentary inquiry was commissioned, and the Independent Commission Against Corruption announced an investigation. The investigation concluded in 2005, with no findings of corruption against any person. However, the Commission recommended that the NSW Government strengthen guidelines for public servants dealing with corruption allegations by lobbyists. Unlike Nick Greiner in 1992 and Barry O'Farrell in 2014, the Orange Grove affair marked the only time that a sitting Premier in Bob  Carr had survived appearing before ICAC although Carr did retire mere months after the conclusion of ICAC's investigation of the Orange Grove affair.

177,Los Alerces National Park,"Los Alerces National Park () is located in the Andes in Chubut Province in the Patagonian region of Argentina. Its western boundary coincides with the Chilean border. Successive glaciations have molded the landscape in the region creating spectacular features such as moraines, glacial cirques and clear-water lakes. The vegetation is dominated by dense temperate forests, which give way to alpine meadows higher up under the rocky Andean peaks. A highly distinctive and emblematic feature is its alerce forest ; the globally threatened alerce tree is the second longest living tree species in the world (> 3,600 years). The alerce forests in the park are in an excellent state of conservation. The property is vital for the protection of some of the last portions of continuous Patagonian Forest in an almost pristine state and is the habitat for a number of endemic and threatened species of flora and fauna.

The society was named after Dante Alighieri (12651321), a pre-Renaissance poet from Florence and the author of The Divine Comedy. Dante is considered the father of the Italian language. In October 1948 the society was restructured at a meeting in Venice to give total autonomy to all chapters of the Dante Society so that each could conduct its activities independently, under the direction of its own elected officers, in a manner that best suited local needs, preferences, and capacities while adhering to the Society's basic principles.

198,Canton of Raetia,"Raetia was the name of a canton of the Helvetic Republic from 1798 to 1803, corresponding to modern Graubnden and composed of the Free State of the Three Leagues. Until 1799, the canton was administered by the central government of the Helvetic Republic. The districts of Chiavenna, Valtellina and Bormio, previously dependencies of the Leagues, were never a part of the canton, having permanently been detached from the Leagues after Revolutionary France fomented revolt there, leading them to be annexed to the Cisalpine Republic on October 10, 1797. The districts subsequently joined the Austrian client kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia after the Congress of Vienna and eventually become the Italian province of Sondrio. The town of Campione, an imperial fief into the Landvogtei of Lugano at the same time, joined Lombardy leading to its current position as an Italian enclave within Ticino. With the Napoleonic Act of Mediation in 1803, the canton was reestablished as Graubnden, finally incorporating the Three Leagues into a decentralized and federal Switzerland.

201,Northern bald ibis,"The northern bald ibis, hermit ibis, or waldrapp (Geronticus eremita) is a migratory bird found in barren, semi-desert or rocky habitats, often close to running water. This glossy black ibis, which, unlike many members of the ibis family, is non-wading, has an unfeathered red face and head, and a long, curved red bill. It breeds colonially on coastal or mountain cliff ledges, where it typically lays two to three eggs in a stick nest, and feeds on lizards, insects, and other small animals. The northern bald ibis was once widespread across the Middle East, northern Africa, southern and central Europe, with a fossil record dating back at least 1.8  million years. It disappeared from Europe over 300 years ago, and is now considered critically endangered. There are believed to be about 500 wild birds remaining in southern Morocco, and fewer than 10 in Syria, where it was rediscovered in 2002. To combat this ebb in numbers, recent reintroduction programs have been instituted internationally, with a semi-wild breeding colony in Turkey, as well as sites in Austria, Spain, and northern Morocco. The reasons for the species ' long-term decline are unclear, but hunting, loss of foraging habitat, and pesticide poisoning have been implicated in the rapid loss of colonies in recent decades.

204,List of Presidents of Ethiopia,"This is a list of Presidents of Ethiopia and also a list of heads of state after the fall of the Ethiopian Empire in 1974. Until 1974, the heads of state of the Ethiopian Empire were either Emperors or regents. From the coup d'tat of the Derg leading to the fall of the Empire in September 1974 until March 1975, the Derg considered the Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen as the nominal head of state  which the Crown Prince refused to accept. During this time, the Chairmen of the Derg, the leaders of the Derg, were to be considered as acting heads of state. After 21 March 1975, the Derg military junta fully took over. Until the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in 1987, still dominated by Derg figures, Chairmen of the Derg have to be considered heads of state  but not presidents. After the fall of the Derg and the establishment of the Transitional Government of Ethiopia in 1991, the first immediate President (Meles Zenawi) has to be considered an Interim President. Since the formal establishment of the office of President in 1987, there have been 6 official presidents. The President is the head of state of Ethiopia. The current president is Sahle-Work Zewde, who is also the first female president of Ethiopia, elected on 25 October 2018 by members of the Federal Parliamentary Assembly.

213,Janaka,"Janaka was a king of Videha, approximately in the 8th or 7th century BCE, who later appears as a character in the Ramayana. He is revered as being an ideal example of non-attachment to material possessions. As a king, he had access to luxuries and pleasures far beyond the ordinary, but his internal state was closer to that of a sadhu. He was intensely interested in spiritual discourse and considered himself free from worldly illusions. His interactions with sages and seekers such as Ashtavakra and Sulabha are recorded in ancient texts. His relationship with adopted daughter Sita led her to be called Janaki Mata. The Nepalese city of Janakpur is named for him and daughter Sita. The Videha (or Mithila) kingdom was located between east of Gandaki River, west of Mahananda River, north of Ganga river and south of Himalayas. The region is now divided between the present day Indian state of Bihar and a small part of Terai Region in Nepal. ","Janaka | child | Sita

214,Pokémon (anime),", abbreviated from the Japanese title of and currently advertised in English as Pokmon : The Series, is a Japanese anime television series, which has been adapted for the international television markets, concurrently airing in 124 countries worldwide. It is part of the Pokmon media franchise, based on Nintendo's Pokmon video game series. The Pokmon animated series is split up into six chronologically sequential series in Japan, split up by the version of the video game series the anime takes inspiration from : the original series, the Advanced Generation series, the Diamond & Pearl series, the Best Wishes ! series, the XY series, and the newest, the Sun & Moon series. In the international broadcasts, these six series are split into 21 separate seasons. These anime series are accompanied by spin-off programming, consisting of Pokmon Chronicles, a series of side stories featuring characters in the anime that are not its current cast of main characters, and the live action variety and Pokmon-related news shows of Weekly Pokmon Broadcasting Station, Pokmon Sunday, Pokmon Smash !, and Pokmon Get TV, premiering in late 2013. The Pokmon anime series was largely credited for allowing anime to become more popular and familiar around the world, especially in the United States, where the two highest-grossing anime films are both Pokmon films. It was also considered to be one of the first anime series on television to reach this level of mainstream success with Western audiences, as well as being credited with allowing the game series to reach such a degree of popularity, and vice versa. The anime series is also regarded as the most successful video game adaptation of all time, with over 1,000 episodes.

216,Ferrous metallurgy,"Ferrous metallurgy is the metallurgy of iron and its alloys. It began far back in prehistory. The earliest surviving iron artifacts, from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt, were made from meteoritic iron-nickel. It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began, but by the end of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being produced from iron ores from Sub-Saharan Africa to China. The use of wrought iron (worked iron) was known by the 1st millennium BC, and its spread marked the Iron Age. During the medieval period, means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron (in this context known as pig iron) using finery forges. For all these processes, charcoal was required as fuel. Steel (with a carbon content between pig iron and wrought iron) was first produced in antiquity as an alloy. Its process of production, Wootz steel, was exported before the 4th century BC from India to ancient China, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Archaeological evidence of cast iron appears in 5th-century BC China. New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century. During the Industrial Revolution, new methods of producing bar iron by substituting coke for charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel, creating a new era of greatly increased use of iron and steel that some contemporaries described as a new Iron Age. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process, that involved blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off carbon, and so to produce mild steel. This and other 19th-century and later steel making processes have displaced wrought iron. Today, wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale, having been displaced by the functionally equivalent mild or low carbon steel. The largest and most modern underground iron ore mine in the world is located in Kiruna, Norrbotten County, Lapland. The mine which is owned by Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB, a large Swedish mining company, has an annual production capacity of over 26 million tonnes of iron ore.

218,Taft–Katsura agreement,"The was a 1905 discussion (not an agreement) between senior leaders of Japan and the United States regarding the positions of the two nations in greater East Asian affairs, especially regarding the status of Korea and Philippines in the aftermath of Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War. It was not an "" agreement "" and did not set out any new policies, but a memorandum. The memorandum was not classified as a secret but no scholar noticed it in the archives until 1924. The discussions were between United States Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Prime Minister of Japan (Count) Katsura Tar on 27 July 1905. The Japanese leader stated Japan's reasons for its making a protectorate of Korea. He repeated that Japan had no interest in the Philippines. The US had acquired the Philippines following its victory over Spain in the Spanish  American War of 1898. In 1924, Tyler Dennett was the first scholar to see the document ; he described it as containing "" the text of perhaps the most remarkable ' executive agreement ' in the history of the foreign relations of the United States "". The consensus of historians is that Dennett greatly exaggerated the importance of a routine discussion that changed nothing and set no new policies. Historians pointed out there was no formal agreement on anything new. The word "" agreement "" in the documents merely means the two sides agreed that the English and Japanese versions of the meeting notes both accurately covered the substance of the conversations. President Theodore Roosevelt later agreed that War Secretary Taft had correctly stated the American position. When Dennett first discovered the notes he assumed they indicated a highly significant "" secret pact "" between the US and Japan in creating a basis agreement whereby the two formerly isolationist nations became world powers. The conversations regarded the extent of the spheres of influence of Japan and the United States, and maintaining peace between them, in the event of victory of Japan over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War. Some Korean historians have assumed that, in the discussions, the United States recognized Japan's sphere of influence in Korea ; in exchange, Japan recognized the United States ' sphere of influence in the Philippines. However, American historians examining official records report no agreement was ever made  the two men discussed current events but came to no new policy or agreement. They both restated the well-known official policies of their own governments. Indeed, Taft was very careful to indicate these were his private opinions, and he was not an official representative of the U.S. government (Taft was Secretary of War, not Secretary of State).

226,Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics,"Between 2008 and 2011, the Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics was an academic center established at the University of Chicago as a collaborative, cross-disciplinary site for research in economics. The Institute aimed to advance, refine, and share research that applied the tools of economic analysis to real-world issues. The institute was named in honor of former Chicago economics professor, Milton Friedman, who is widely recognized for his many enduring contributions to economic analysis. The institute was a collaboration of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Department of Economics, and Law School and fostered inquiry across a wide range of topics and subfields. The institute aimed to advance and preserve the unique University of Chicago economic tradition of combining theory and data in rigorous analysis -- an approach exemplified by Friedman and others. The Institute hosted visiting scholars working in subfields of economics, business, law, and related fields such as public policy and medicine. It hosted workshops, seminars, and lectures on fundamental questions across these fields. The Institute also supported advanced professional training for post-doctoral students, as well as expanded opportunities for University of Chicago graduate students. When announcing the creation of the institute in 2008, University President Robert J. Zimmer said its goal was to create "" a primary intellectual destination for economics by creating a robust forum for engagement of our faculty and students with scholars and policymakers from around the world.  The university had initially planned to invest $ 200 million in the institute, with half of that in the form of an operating endowment ; though the majority of funds were to be raised through donations. The institute was an object of intense controversy at the university, as many faculty objected both to its objectives as originally framed and to the naming of an institute after Friedman, who was viewed as polarizing. The announcement of the institute drew a response from more than 170 of the faculty at the university, who argued that to found such an institute would constitute "" a symbolic endorsement of his views by the University "" and that the proposal reflected "" a very narrow research scope even within the field of economics, not to speak of the complete disregard for other disciplines involved in the study of ' economy and society ' "". In June 2011, the institute and the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory were joined to form the new Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics.

230,Trail Smelter dispute,"The Trail Smelter dispute was a trans-boundary pollution case involving the federal governments of both Canada and the United States, which eventually contributed to establishing the Harm principle in the environmental law of transboundary pollution. The smelter in Trail, British Columbia was historically operated by the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company (COMINCO) until COMINCO merged with Teck in 2001, and has processed lead and zinc since 1896. Smoke from the smelter caused damage to forests and crops in the surrounding area and also across the Canada  US border in Washington. The smoke from the smelter distressed residents, resulting in complaints to COMINCO and demands for compensation. The dispute between the smelter operators and affected landowners could not be resolved, resulting in the case being sent to an arbitration tribunal. Negotiation and resulting litigation and arbitration was settled in 1941. ","Trail Smelter dispute | country | Canada

237,Tonie Marshall,"Tonie Marshall (born 29 November 1951) is a French American actress, screenwriter, and film director. After acting in several of Jacques Demy s films, including A Slightly Pregnant Man and La Naissance du Jour, Marshall cites to have taken influence from his direction in the sense of creating whimsical atmospheres and rooting the stories with more of a female-centric narrative. In her most notable film, Venus Beauty Institute, Marshall s touched on the theme of finding love from a female perspective, and how it can fundamentally be more difficult because of how it strays from the traditional dynamic of courtship. She explains how  in a practical sense, it s complicated to have abandon [ oneself ] into a man s arms and, at the same time, stay very tough because you have to work  . This carefully expresses the vulnerabilities women endure when heavily committing to relationships, similar to much of Demy s work, including The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and The Young Girls of Rochefort.

242,Sims-class destroyer,"The Sims class destroyers were built for the United States Navy, and commissioned in 1939 and 1940. These twelve ships were the last United States destroyer class completed prior to the American entry into World War II. All Sims-class ships saw action in World War II, and seven survived the war. No ship of this class saw service after 1946. They were built under the Second London Naval Treaty, in which the limit on destroyer standard displacement was lifted, but an overall limit remained. Thus, to maximize the number of destroyers and avoid developing an all-new design, the Sims class were only 70 tons larger as designed than previous destroyers. They are usually grouped with the 1500-ton classes and were the sixth destroyer class since production resumed with the Farragut class in 1932. The class served extensively in World War II, and five of the class were lost in the war. Of the five ships lost, four were at the hands of the Japanese and one at the hands of the Germans. The class served on Neutrality Patrols in the Atlantic in 1940-41. Except for Roe, Wainwright, and Buck, the class was transferred to the Pacific shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. All of the ships saw extensive combat service. At the war's end in August 1945, three of the seven survivors were undergoing overhauls that were left unfinished, and were ultimately scrapped. The remaining four seaworthy ships were used as targets during the 1946 Operation Crossroads atomic tests at Bikini Atoll. One was sunk by the first blast, while the other three were sunk as targets two years later after serving as experimental platforms. ","the United States Navy | country | United States

250,The Scribe (film),"The Scribe is a 1966 comedy film short starring Buster Keaton in his last film role before his death from lung cancer on February 1, 1966. It was produced by the Construction Safety Association of Ontario, Canada to promote Construction site safety, and was filmed where the Ontario Government Buildings were under construction in Toronto. The director was John Sebert. Keaton portrays the janitor at a newspaper who accidentally intercepts a call from the editor, ordering him to do a story about safety practices at a massive construction site. He sneaks onto the construction site and finds a list of 16 safety rules posted on a wall. He takes the list and attempts to confront workers when he sees them acting in an unsafe manner, often causing more accidents than he prevents. Keaton is silent throughout the film as he recreates several routines from his youth. Most notable was his recreation of a gag from his 1918 film The Bell Boy in which he mops the floor using only the tip of the mop, little by little while sitting on the floor.

257,Ninety-Two Resolutions,"The Ninety-Two Resolutions were drafted by Louis-Joseph Papineau and other members of the Parti patriote of Lower Canada in 1834. The resolutions were a long series of demands for political reforms in the British-governed colony. Papineau had been elected speaker of the legislative assembly of Lower Canada in 1815. His party constantly opposed the unelected colonial government, and in 1828 he helped draft an early form of the resolutions, essentially a list of grievances against the colonial administration. To ensure that the views of the Legislative Assembly be understood by the British House of Commons, the Parti patriote had sent its own delegation to London in order to submit a memoir and a petition signed by 87,000 people. On February 28, 1834, Papineau presented the Ninety-Two Resolutions to the Legislative Assembly which were approved and sent to London. The resolutions included, among other things, demands for an elected Legislative Council and an Executive Council responsible before the house of representatives. Under the Constitutional Act of 1791, the government of Lower Canada was given an elected legislative assembly, but members of the upper houses were appointed by the Governor of the colony. In the resolutions, the elected representatives once again reiterated their loyalty to the British Crown, but expressed frustration that the government of London had been unwilling to correct the injustices caused by the past governments of the colony. Papineau's resolutions were ignored for almost three years ; meanwhile, the Legislative Assembly did all it could to oppose the un-elected upper houses while avoiding outright rebellion. British Colonial Secretary Lord Russell eventually responded to them by issuing ten resolutions of his own (the Russell Resolutions). All of the Legislative Assembly's demands were rejected. The ten resolutions reached Canada in 1837, and many of Papineau's reformists began to agitate for a rebellion. See the Lower Canada Rebellion.

258,Orange (India),"The Orange brand in India, through a complicated set of mergers and divisions, was acquired and eventually retained by Orange S.A. ; and currently operates as Orange Business Services India (OBS India). On 14 February 2000, Hutchison Max  an Indian telecom joint venture majority owned by Hong Kong based Hutchison Whampoa introduced the brand in the country, through the rebranding of its existing Mumbai telecom circle Cell phone service  ' Max Touch ', to ' Orange '. Shortly, issues arose concerning the ownership of the ' Orange ' brand in India, when France Telecom in May 2000 purchased the worldwide rights for the brand. Hutchison Essar (earlier Hutchinson Max) ended using the brand in Jan 2006. Orange returned to the country in July 2007, as Orange Business Services India, when France Telecom acquired the enterprise network services and managed services business of GTL Ltd. Since then, OBS India has grown to become one of the country's major data connectivity solutions provider. Currently, it has a network with 14 points of presence (PoP) in the country and has offices in eight locations with over 1500 employees, offering business services to local as well as global enterprises in cloud computing, unified communications and collaboration.

273,Sharpbelly,"The sharpbelly or wild carp, Korean sharpbelly, or common sawbelly (Hemiculter leucisculus), is a tropical freshwater and brackish water fish belonging to the Cultrinae subfamily of the family Cyprinidae. It originates in large streams and reservoirs in China, Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, and the Amur River basin. It has become established as an exotic species in several other countries, including Iran, Afghanistan, and the former Soviet Union, where it has displaced local species. It was originally described as Culter leucisculus by S. Basilewsky in 1855, and has also been referred to as Chanodichthys leucisculus and Hemiculter leucisculus warpachowskii in scientific literature. The fish reaches a size up to 23.0  cm (9.1  in) long, and is native to fresh and brackish water habitats with a pH of 7.0, a hardness of 15 DH, and a temperature of 18 to 22   C (64 to 72   F).

The bill was sponsored by Senator Robert F. Wagner (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Edith Rogers (R-Mass.) in the wake of the 1938 Kristallnacht attacks on Jews in Germany. The bill was introduced to Congress on February 9, 1939. The bill had widespread support among religious and labor groups, but was opposed by nationalist organizations. It never came to a vote because it was blocked by Senator Robert Rice Reynolds of North Carolina, who held a powerful position because of his seniority. Reynolds was an anti-Semite and Anglophobe who was among those whose support President Roosevelt needed for American rearmament. ","Edith Rogers | country of citizenship | United States

It is set in England in the late 15th century, and follows the exploits of the fictitious Prince Edmund as he is invested as Archbishop of Canterbury amid a Machiavellian plot by the King to acquire lands from the Catholic Church. Most of the humour in the episode relies on religious satire. The script pays tribute to the real-life 12th century Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket. Edmund, faced with the threat of assassination, attempts to escape to France into self-imposed exile ; and in a later scene, two drunk knights overhear King Richard IV exclaiming "" Who will rid me of this turbulent priest ? "", the words attributed to King Henry II which led to Becket's death in 1170, and embark on a mission to murder Edmund. "" The Archbishop "" won an International Emmy Award in 1983 in the Popular Arts category. The Catholic Church was to be satirized again in the second series, Blackadder II, in the 1986 episode "" Money "". ","Prince Edmund | position held | Archbishop of Canterbury

285,Enterprise Objects Framework,"The Enterprise Objects Framework, or more commonly simply EOF, was introduced by NeXT in 1994 as a pioneering object-relational mapping product for its NeXTSTEP and OpenStep development platforms. EOF abstracts the process of interacting with a relational database by mapping database rows to Java or Objective-C objects. This largely relieves developers from writing low-level SQL code. EOF enjoyed some niche success in the mid-1990s among financial institutions who were attracted to the rapid application development advantages of NeXT's object-oriented platform. Since Apple Inc's merger with NeXT in 1996, EOF has evolved into a fully integrated part of WebObjects, an application server also originally from NeXT. Many of the core concepts of EOF re-emerged as part of Core Data, which further abstracts the underlying data formats to allow it to be based on non-SQL stores.

286,Boulevard des Capucines,"The Boulevard des Capucines is one of the four ' grands boulevards ' in Paris, a chain of boulevards running east-west that also includes Boulevard de la Madeleine, Boulevard des Italiens, and Boulevard Montmartre. The name comes from a beautiful convent of Capuchin nuns whose garden was on the south side of the boulevard prior to the French Revolution. The former name, Rue Basse-du-Rempart ("" bottom-of-the-wall street "" in French), suggests that, in the beginning, the street paralleled the city wall of Paris. Then, when the wall was destroyed, the street was widened and became a boulevard. Piet Mondrian's little known story De groote boulevards (Les Grands Boulevards), written in 1920 in Paris at the instance of Theo van Doesburg, was inspired by the Boulevard des Capucines.

288,Andrew Fastow,"Andrew Stuart Fastow (born December 22, 1961) is a convicted criminal and businessman who was the chief financial officer of Enron Corporation, an energy trading company based in Houston, Texas, until he was fired shortly before the company declared bankruptcy. Fastow was one of the key figures behind the complex web of off-balance-sheet special purpose entities (limited partnerships which Enron controlled) used to conceal Enron's massive losses in their quarterly balance sheets. By unlawfully maintaining personal stakes in these ostensibly independent ghost-entities, he was able to defraud Enron out of tens of millions of dollars. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently opened an investigation into his and the company's conduct in 2001. Fastow served a six-year prison sentence for charges related to these acts. His wife, Lea Weingarten, also worked at Enron, where she was an assistant treasurer ; she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering conspiracy and filing fraudulent income tax returns, and served jail time before early release to a halfway house.

290,Alice Bunker Stockham,"Alice Bunker Stockham (November 8, 1833 in Cardington, Ohio  December 3, 1912 in Alhambra, California) was an obstetrician and gynecologist from Chicago and the fifth woman to become a doctor in the United States. She promoted gender equality, dress reform, birth control, and male and female sexual fulfillment for successful marriages. A well-traveled and well-read person who counted among her friends Leo Tolstoy and Havelock Ellis, she also visited Sweden and from her trips to schools there she brought back the idea of teaching children domestic crafts, thus single-handedly establishing shop and home economics classes in the United States. Stockham lectured against the use of corsets by women, made public endorsements of the healthiness of masturbation for both men and women (still controversial when echoed by U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders more than 100 years later), advocated complete abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, and believed in women's rights. Stockham was very concerned with the economic plight of divorced women with children and prostitutes who wanted to get off the street. She felt that these women had no marketable skills and would be unable to support themselves, so she had copies of her book Tokology, a layperson's guide to gynecology and midwifery, privately printed and gave them to "" unfortunate women "" to sell door-to-door in Chicago. Each copy came with a bound-in certificate signed by Stockham and entitling the bearer to a free gynecological exam. In 1905, a then 72-year old Stockham and her publisher were convicted of circulating improper literature under the Comstock laws. ","Alice Bunker Stockham | date of birth | November 8, 1833

291,Ramblin' on My Mind,""" Ramblin ' on My Mind "" is a blues song recorded on November 23, 1936 in San Antonio, Texas by blues musician Robert Johnson. The song was originally released on 78 rpm format as Vocalion 03519 and ARC 7-05-81. Johnson performed the song in the key of E, and recorded two takes. Both takes were used for different pressings of both the Vocalion issue and the ARC issue. The song used the melody made popular by the hit record "" M & O Blues "" by Walter Davis. Johnson composed two songs to this melody, "" Ramblin ' on My Mind "" and "" When You Got a Good Friend "", with different musical approaches and different guitar tunings, although both were in the key of E. For "" Ramblin ' on My Mind "" he used an open tuning that allowed him to combine a boogie shuffle on the bass strings with bottleneck triplets on the treble strings. These slide triplets were the model for Elmore James's guitar accompaniment to "" Dust My Broom "". The song was recorded by John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton on lead vocals and featured on the album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (1966), and by Clapton on the albums Just One Night,, Sessions for Robert J, and on Live from Madison Square Garden. Lucinda Williams also recorded it for her first professional release, Ramblin ' (1979). ","When You Got a Good Friend | performer | Robert Johnson

300,Fugue,"In music, a fugue () is a contrapuntal compositional technique in two or more voices, built on a subject (a musical theme) that is introduced at the beginning in imitation (repetition at different pitches) and which recurs frequently in the course of the composition. It is not to be confused with a fuguing tune, which is a style of song popularized by and mostly limited to early American (i.e. shape note or "" Sacred Harp "") music and West Gallery music. A fugue usually has three main sections : an exposition, a development and a final entry that contains the return of the subject in the fugue's tonic key. Some fugues have a recapitulation. In the Middle Ages, the term was widely used to denote any works in canonic style ; by the Renaissance, it had come to denote specifically imitative works. Since the 17th century, the term fugue has described what is commonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative counterpoint. Most fugues open with a short main theme, the subject, which then sounds successively in each voice (after the first voice is finished stating the subject, a second voice repeats the subject at a different pitch, and other voices repeat in the same way) ; when each voice has entered, the exposition is complete. This is often followed by a connecting passage, or episode, developed from previously heard material ; further "" entries "" of the subject then are heard in related keys. Episodes (if applicable) and entries are usually alternated until the "" final entry "" of the subject, by which point the music has returned to the opening key, or tonic, which is often followed by closing material, the coda. In this sense, a fugue is a style of composition, rather than a fixed structure. The form evolved during the 18th century from several earlier types of contrapuntal compositions, such as imitative ricercars, capriccios, canzonas, and fantasias. The famous fugue composer Johann Sebastian Bach (16851750) shaped his own works after those of Johann Jakob Froberger (1616  1667), Johann Pachelbel (1653  1706), Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583  1643), Dieterich Buxtehude (c. 16371707) and others. With the decline of sophisticated styles at the end of the baroque period, the fugue's central role waned, eventually giving way as sonata form and the symphony orchestra rose to a dominant position. Nevertheless, composers continued to write and study fugues for various purposes ; they appear in the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756  1791) and Ludwig van Beethoven (1770  1827), as well as modern composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich (1906  1975).

307,Treaty of Ghent,"The Treaty of Ghent () was the peace treaty that ended the War of 1812 between the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Both sides signed it on December 24, 1814, in the city of Ghent, United Netherlands. The treaty restored relations between the two nations to status quo ante bellum, restoring the borders of the two countries to the lines before the war started in June 1812. The treaty was approved by the UK parliament and signed into law by the Prince Regent (the future King George IV) on December 30, 1814. It took a month for news of the peace treaty to reach the United States, and in the meantime American forces under Andrew Jackson won the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815. The Treaty of Ghent was not fully in effect until it was ratified by the U.S. Senate unanimously on February 17, 1815. It began two centuries and more of peaceful relations between the U.S. and Britain, although there were a few tense moments such as the Trent Affair in 1861. ","War of 1812 | participant | U.S.

310,Malo (saint),"Saint Malo (; also known as Maclou or Mac'h Low, or in Latin as Maclovius or Machutus, born 27 March 520  died 15 November 621) was a mid-sixth century founder of Saint-Malo, a commune in Brittany, France. He was one of the seven founding saints of Brittany. Saint Malo of Aleth was baptized as an adult by Saint Brendan the Navigator. He became a student of Saint Brendan. As a monk at Llancarfan Abbey in Wales, Saint Malo was known for his participation in the famous Voyage of Saint Brendan. As an Immigrant to Brittany, he helped in the missionary work of Saint Aaron of Brittany, was the first bishop of Aleth (modern Saint-Servan, France) and established churches in the area of Brittany now named Saint-Malo in his honor. Saint Malo of Aleth was later driven from the area to Saintes, France by opponents of his mission. Details of Malo's career have been preserved in three medieval ' Lives ' that seem to include incidents associated with multiple people bearing a similar name. It appears that Saint Malo of Aleth was probably born in Wales in approximately 520. Malo's name may derive from the Old Breton machlou, a compound of mach "" warrant, hostage "" and lou (or loh) "" brilliant, bright, beautiful "". ","Brittany | country | France

320,Music of the American Civil War,"During the American Civil War, music played a prominent role on both sides of the conflict : Union and Confederate. On the American Civil War battlefield, different instruments including bugles, drums, and fifes were played to issue marching orders or sometimes simply to boost the morale of one's fellow soldiers. Singing was also employed as a recreational activity but as a release from the inevitable tensions that come with fighting in a war, particularly a war in which the issue of freedom of a race is to be decided. In camp, music was a diversion away from the bloodshed, helping the soldiers deal with homesickness and boredom. Soldiers of both sides often engaged in recreation with musical instruments, and when the opposing armies were near each other, sometimes the bands from both sides of the conflict played against each other on the night before a battle. Each side had its particular favorite tunes, while some music was enjoyed by Northerners and Southerners alike, as exemplified by United States President Abraham Lincoln's love of Dixie, the unofficial anthem of the Confederacy. To this day, many of the songs are sung when a patriotic piece is required. The war's music also inspired music artists such as Lynyrd Skynyrd and Elvis Presley.

321,America's Sweetheart (album),"America's Sweetheart is the debut studio album by American alternative rock musician Courtney Love, released worldwide on February 10, 2004 by Virgin Records. Her first official release after her former band Hole's break-up, the album's sound diverged significantly in musical and lyrical content to Hole's three previous studio albums : Pretty on the Inside (1991), Live Through This (1994) and Celebrity Skin (1998). The recording process of the album began in summer 2001 in Los Angeles, California, however, was affected drastically by a number of personal and legal issues by Love ; including her drug problems, the disbandment of Hole, the controversy surrounding Nirvana's upcoming box set, and legal problems with various record labels. In spring 2003, Love traveled to southern France to re-record the album, however, according to Love, she "" just wanted to be in a chteau for six months and do drugs. "" The album had three main producers, one of whom, James Barber, was Love's partner at the time. Following recording, America's Sweetheart was further delayed due to Virgin's excessive input on the album's mastering, art work and design, and track listing. Upon its release, it received little promotion, with the main source of media exposure being a music video for the album's first single, "" Mono, "" and Love's highly publicised drug issues. America's Sweetheart received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure, selling little over 200,000 copies in the United States, and with Love further citing the album as "" a mistake. "" In more recent years, both Love and producer Linda Perry have referred to the album as "" le disaster "" and "" ruined because [ Love ] was coked out, "" respectively. The album featured drumming from former Hole drummer Patty Schemel, as well as guest instrumentation and vocals from Emilie Autumn. ","America 's Sweetheart | publication date | February 10, 2004

It was relaunched in its present form on 1st of April 2006 in the Athens metropolitan area, and gradually spread its coverage nationwide. Besides digital terrestrial transmission, it is available on the subscription-based encrypted services of Nova and Cosmote TV. Skai TV is also a member of Digea, a consortium of private television networks introducing digital terrestrial transmission in Greece. At launch, Skai TV opted for dubbing all foreign language content into Greek, instead of using subtitles. This is very uncommon in Greece for anything except documentaries (using voiceover dubbing) and children's programmes (using lip-synced dubbing), so after intense criticism the station switched to using subtitles for almost all foreign shows.

Native Americans used the river as transportation route and portage. When French explorers and missionaries arrived in the 1600s, in what was then the Illinois Country of New France, they named the waterway La Rivire des Plaines (River of the Plane Tree) as they felt that trees on the river resembled the European plane tree.

328,Master Chief (Halo),"MCPON John-117, or "" Master Chief "", is a fictional character and the protagonist of the Halo fictional universe created by Bungie. Master Chief is a playable character in the series of science fiction first-person shooter video games, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 4, and. Outside video games, the character appears in books and graphic novels,,, and and has cameos in other Halo media, including,, The Halo Graphic Novel, Halo Legends and. The Master Chief is a towering biochemically and cybernetically-enhanced supersoldier, raised and trained from an early age to be a weapon ; he is almost faceless, never seen without his green-colored armor and helmet. He is commonly referred to by his naval rank, rather than his given birth-name or serial-designation. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a Chicago disc jockey, in the video games in which he appears. Downes based his personification of the Chief on an initial character sketch which called for a Clint Eastwood  type character of few words. The Master Chief is a video game icon, a relative newcomer among more established franchise characters, such as Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog and Lara Croft. The character has received a mostly positive reception. While some have described the Chief's silent and faceless nature as a weakness of the character, other publications have suggested these attributes better allow players to assume his role.

332,Matagorda Bay,"Matagorda Bay () is a large Gulf of Mexico estuary bay on the Texas coast, lying in Calhoun and Matagorda counties and located approximately northeast of Corpus Christi, east-southeast of San Antonio, south-southwest of Houston, and south-southeast of Austin. It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by Matagorda Peninsula and serves as the mouth of numerous streams, most notably the Lavaca and Colorado Rivers. The Texas seaport of Port Lavaca is located on the system's northwestern extension of Lavaca Bay. The city of Palacios is found on northeastern extension of Tres Palacios Bay, and Port O'Connor is located on the southwestern tip of the main bay's shore. The ghost town of Indianola, which was a major port before it was destroyed by two hurricanes in the late 19th Century, is also found on the bay. The bay's shore, especially near the Colorado River delta, provides a habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. The wildlife serves as a basis for the birding and fishing tourism, and is an essential component of the production of seafood, specifically shrimp and blue crab, which are the specialties of the area. The fertile land near the bay is ideal for farming, especially for the propagation of rice. ","Matagorda | located in the administrative territorial entity | Texas

333,Clandestine literature,"Clandestine literature, also called "" underground literature "", refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves self-publishing works, often in contradiction with the legal standards of a location. Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship, prosecution, or other suppression. In academic study, such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications (as opposed to officially sanctioned, orthodox publishing). Examples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents ; the Aljamiado literature of Al-Andalus Spain ; and the nushu writing of some upper-class women in Hunan, China, from around the 10th century to the 19th century. Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th-century France, circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts, usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien Rgime, or even straight out atheist. These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s, and contained such controversial works as Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament. Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire, but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe. The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France. These books were usually termed "" philosophical works "", but varied greatly in content from pornography, utopian novels, political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like Baron d'Holbach, Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons, when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power, but also for reasons at a formal level, when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works. Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose ; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs, often being funded by the authors themselves. Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature, such as Das Kapital and El Buscn. A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad. The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20th-century English-language writers, including Henry Miller, who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time.

344,Francisco Asenjo Barbieri,"Francisco Asenjo Barbieri (3 August 1823  19 February 1894) was a well-known composer of the popular Spanish opera form, zarzuela. His works include : El barberillo de Lavapis, Jugar con fuego, Pan y toros, Don Quijote, Los diamantes de la corona, and El Diablo en el poder. He was born and died in Madrid, appropriately, since the themes are characters of his operas are often distinctly Spanish and Madrilenian. Among the characters featured by Barbieri are bullfighters, manolos and manolas, and even (in Pan y toros) the famous Spanish painter, Francisco Goya. The character of much of Barbieri s work is farcical, utilizing mistaken identity and other devices to entertain the audience. His themes deal largely with the ins and outs of love, and the relations between the upper and lower classes in nineteenth-century Spain, but there is also a distinct political character to much of his work. The zarzuelas El barberillo de Lavapis and Pan y toros both contain plots to overthrow the government. In addition to his compositions, Barbieri was also an accomplished musician. He was the founder of La Espaa Musical (a society for the promotion of Spanish operetta) and the Society for Orchestral Music. ","Francisco Asenjo Barbieri | place of birth | Madrid

345,Bicycles &amp; Tricycles,"Bicycles & Tricycles is the sixth studio album from the Orb. It brought together The Orb's style of the early 1990s with current electronic music to mixed reactions. The Daily Telegraph praised Bicycles & Tricycles as being "" inclusive, exploratory, and an enjoyable journey "" ; however, many other publications dismissed it as "" stoner dub "" and largely irrelevant to current electronic music culture. In addition to Paterson, Roome, Phillips, and Fehlmann, The Corporal contributed with vocoder affected singing and MC Soom-T provided lyrics and rapped. Orb co-founder Jimmy Cauty, too, made a guest appearance as co-writer on Bicycles & Tricycles ' "" From a Distance "". After departing from Island Records, The Orb released Bicycles & Tricycles in 2004 on Cooking Vinyl in the United Kingdom and Sanctuary Records in the United States. To promote the album, The Orb began a UK tour with dub reggae artist Mad Professor, who had remixed The Orb in the past. Though The Orb still pulled in large crowds, The Guardian described one London performance as "" joyless "" and stated that "" few of the new tracks... really go anywhere "". They also noted that Paterson seemed to be far more comfortable and happier to play material from Bicycles & Tricycles rather than older tracks. Paterson's biggest influences for the album were drum and bass and trip hop music. ","Orb | has part | Jimmy Cauty

349,Henry Halleck,"Henry Wager Halleck (January 16, 1815  January 9, 1872) was a United States Army officer, scholar, and lawyer. A noted expert in military studies, he was known by a nickname that became derogatory : "" Old Brains. "" He was an important participant in the admission of California as a state and became a successful lawyer and land developer. Halleck served as General-in-Chief of all Union armies during the American Civil War. Early in the Civil War, Halleck was a senior Union Army commander in the Western Theater. He commanded operations in the Western Theater from 1861 until 1862, during which time, while the Union armies in the east were defeated and held back, the troops under Halleck's command won many important victories. However, Halleck was not present at the battles, and his subordinates earned most of the recognition. The only operation in which Halleck exercised field command was the Siege of Corinth in the spring of 1862, a Union victory which he conducted with extreme caution. Halleck also developed rivalries with many of his subordinate generals, such as Ulysses S. Grant and Don Carlos Buell. In July 1862, following Major General George B. McClellan's failed Peninsula Campaign in the Eastern Theater, Halleck was promoted to general-in-chief of all U.S. armies. Halleck served in this capacity for about a year and a half. Halleck was a cautious general who believed strongly in thorough preparations for battle and in the value of defensive fortifications over quick, aggressive action. He was a master of administration, logistics, and the politics necessary at the top of the military hierarchy, but exerted little effective control over field operations from his post in Washington, D.C. His subordinates frequently criticized him and at times ignored his instructions. President Abraham Lincoln once described him as "" little more than a first rate clerk. "" In March 1864, Grant was promoted to general-in-chief, and Halleck was relegated to chief-of-staff. Without the pressure of having to control the movements of the armies, Halleck performed capably in this task, ensuring that the Union armies were well-equipped.

350,Laurence M. Keitt,"Laurence Massillon Keitt (October 4, 1824  June 2, 1864) was an American planter, lawyer, politician, and soldier from South Carolina. During his tenure in the United States House of Representatives, he was included in several lists of Fire-Eaters  men who adamantly urged the secession of southern states from the United States, and who resisted measures of compromise and reconciliation, leading to the American Civil War. Keitt is notable for being involved in two separate acts of legislative violence in the Congressional chambers. In the first, Keitt assisted Representative Preston Brooks (D-SC) in his 1856 attack on Senator Charles Sumner (R-MA) in the Senate chamber by brandishing a pistol and cane to prevent other Senators from coming to Sumner's aid. The second was in 1858, when he attacked and attempted to choke Representative Galusha Grow (R-PA) during an argument on the floor of the U.S. House. When the Civil War began, he served as a deputy of the Provisional Confederate States Congress and later as a colonel in the Confederate States Army, until he was mortally wounded at the Battle of Cold Harbor in June 1864.

352,White Light Rock &amp; Roll Review,"White Light Rock & Roll Review is Matthew Good's second album as a solo artist, and was released on June 15, 2004. Though it was not as well-received as his previous solo effort, Avalanche, it quickly achieved Gold certification in Canada. Recording sessions for White Light Rock & Roll Review began less than a year after the release of Avalanche, making it the shortest time spent between records for Good. Having become disenchanted with the state of recorded music, Good became enamored with the techniques employed by classic artists like Led Zeppelin and The Who, who spent much of their careers perfecting their live shows and recording albums live off the floor. To this end, Good sought to write songs that could best be conveyed to live audiences. In fact, many of the record's tracks (including "" Little Terror "", "" North American for Life "", "" Blue Skies Over Bad Lands "", "" It's Been A While Since I Was Your Man "", and "" Ex-Pats of the Blue Mountain Symphony Orchestra "") were written and performed live, well in advance of the album's release.

354,SS Keno,"The SS Keno is a preserved historic sternwheel paddle steamer and National Historic Site of Canada. The SS Keno is berthed in a dry dock on the waterfront of the Yukon River in Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. The vessel was constructed in 1922, in Whitehorse, by the British Yukon Navigation Company, a subsidiary of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway company. For most of its career it transported silver, zinc and lead ore down the Stewart River from mines in the Mayo district to the confluence of the Yukon and Stewart rivers at Stewart City. It was retired from commercial service in 1951 due to the extension and improvement of the Klondike Highway in the years after World War II. Following its withdrawal from service the SS Keno was laid up at the BYN Co. shipyard in Whitehorse, before being selected for preservation and donated by the company to the Canadian Government in 1959. On 25 August 1960 the Keno left Whitehorse to sail downstream to Dawson City. In doing so she became the last of the Yukon's sternwheeler steamers to navigate the Yukon River under her own power. Three days later she arrived in Dawson and was subsequently installed as a tourist attraction and a permanent memorial to the approximately 250 sternwheelers that provided a vital transport service on the Yukon River and its tributaries during the latter half of the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries.

It was opened in 1994 on the site of the main political prison of the former East German Communist Ministry of State Security, the Stasi. Unlike many other government and military institutions in East Germany, Hohenschnhausen prison was not stormed by demonstrators after the fall of the Berlin Wall, allowing prison authorities to destroy evidence of the prison's functions and history. Because of this, today's knowledge of the functioning of the prison comes mainly from eye-witness accounts and documents sourced from other East German institutions. The prison was depicted in the 2006 film The Lives of Others, and in 2017 TV series The Same Sky. It is a member organisation of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience.

360,Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk,""" Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk "" () is the eleventh episode of The Simpsons ' third season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 5, 1991. In the episode, Mr. Burns wishes to pursue other interests and therefore decides to sell his power plant to two German investors for $ 100 million. Safety inspector Homer is immediately fired by the Germans because of his incompetence. Later, Burns realizes that he has lost all his respectability because he can no longer control anyone. The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Mark Kirkland. Originally, the writers wanted to have Burns sell the plant to the Japanese, but they decided that it would have been too clichd ; the plot, however, remained the same with the Germans. The title is an inaccurate German translation of "" Burns sells the power plant "", the correct version being Burns verkauft das Kraftwerk. In its original airing on the Fox network, the episode had a 12.6 Nielsen rating, finishing the week ranked 38th. "" Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk "" received generally positive reviews from critics and was praised for several scenes, particularly the "" Land of Chocolate "" sequence in which Homer dances around in an imaginary land made entirely out of chocolate. The sequence was also remade in cutscenes from the episode in The Simpsons Game. ","Fox | country | the United States

361,The Wedding Dance,"The Wedding Dance (sometimes known as The Dance Village) is a 1566 oil-on-panel painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Owned by the museum of the Detroit Institute of Arts in Detroit, Michigan, the work was discovered by its director in England in 1930, and brought to Detroit. It is believed to be one of a set of three Bruegel works from around the same time, The Wedding Dance, The Peasant Wedding (1567) and The Peasant Dance (1569). The painting depicts 125 wedding guests. As was customary in the Renaissance period, the brides wore black and men wore codpieces. Voyeurism is depicted throughout the entire art work ; dancing was disapproved of by the authorities and the church, and the painting can be seen as both a critique and comic depiction of a stereotypical oversexed, overindulgent, peasant class of the times.

362,Genocide of indigenous peoples,"The genocide of indigenous peoples is the mass destruction of entire communities of indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples are understood to be people whose historical and current territory has become occupied by colonial expansion, or the formation of a state by a dominant group such as a colonial power. While the concept of genocide was formulated by Raphael Lemkin in the mid-20th century, the earlier expansion of various European colonial powers such as the Spanish and British empires, and the subsequent establishment of colonies on indigenous territory, frequently involved acts of genocidal violence against indigenous groups in the Americas, Australia, Africa and Asia. According to Lemkin, colonization was in itself "" intrinsically genocidal "". He saw this genocide as a two-stage process, the first being the destruction of the indigenous population's way of life. In the second stage, the newcomers impose their way of life on the indigenous group. According to David Maybury-Lewis, imperial and colonial forms of genocide are enacted in two main ways, either through the deliberate clearing of territories of their original inhabitants in order to make them exploitable for purposes of resource extraction or colonial settlements, or through enlisting indigenous peoples as forced laborers in colonial or imperialist projects of resource extraction. The designation of specific events as genocidal is often controversial. Some scholars, among them Lemkin, have argued that cultural genocide, sometimes called ethnocide, should also be recognized. A people may continue to exist, but if they are prevented from perpetuating their group identity by prohibitions against cultural and religious practices that are the basis of that identity, this may also be considered a form of genocide. Examples include the treatment of Tibetans by the Chinese government and Native Americans by the US government. ","Native Americans | country | US

364,Jephté,"Jepht (Jephtha) is an opera by the French composer Michel Pignolet de Montclair. It takes the form of a tragdie en musique in a prologue and five acts (because of its subject matter it was also styled a tragdie biblique). The libretto, by the Abb Simon-Joseph Pellegrin, is based on the Biblical story of Jephtha. The oratorio was first performed at the Acadmie royale de musique, Paris on 28 February 1732. It was the first opera in France using a story from the Bible to appear on a public stage. For this reason, Cardinal de Noailles banned performances of the work for a time. Montclair made revisions for revivals of the work in March 1732 and April 1737. In 1735, the soprano who had premiered Iphise, Catherine-Nicole Lemaure, was forced to appear in that year's revival via threats of imprisonment if she would not do so ; therefore, she intentionally bombed the performance and was booed at by the audience. She was detained overnight at For-l'vque, a Parisian prison, until she returned the next night to sing the role correctly. ","Michel Pignolet de Montéclair | country of citizenship | France

367,Religious education in Romania,"The Romanian Revolution of 1989, which ended the Communist regime of Nicolae Ceauescu in December 1989, offered the 15 religious denominations then recognized in Romania the chance to regain the terrain lost after 1945, the year when Dr. Petru Groza of the Ploughmen's Front, a party closely associated with the Communists, became prime minister. From that time, the Communist Party started a campaign of secularisation, seeking to transform the country into an atheistic state along Marxist-Leninist lines. Beginning with the 1989 revolution, the legally recognized churches, especially the Romanian Orthodox Church, the country s largest religious group, pressured the post-communist authorities to introduce religious education in public schools, offer substantial financial support for theological institutions and allow denominations to resume their social role by posting clergy in hospitals, elderly care homes and prisons. Although education was an area where churches registered success in the early stages of post-communist transition, religious education remains a low priority in Romania.

369,Antioch,"Antioch on the Orontes (; ; also Syrian Antioch) was an ancient Greek city on the eastern side of the Orontes River. Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya, Turkey, and lends the modern city its name. Antioch was founded near the end of the fourth century BC by Seleucus I Nicator, one of Alexander the Great's generals. The city's geographical, military, and economic location benefited its occupants, particularly such features as the spice trade, the Silk Road, and the Royal Road. It eventually rivaled Alexandria as the chief city of the Near East. It was also the main center of Hellenistic Judaism at the end of the Second Temple period. Most of the urban development of Antioch occurred during the Roman Empire, when the city was one of the most important in the eastern Mediterranean area of Rome's dominions. Antioch was called "" the cradle of Christianity "" as a result of its longevity and the pivotal role that it played in the emergence of both Hellenistic Judaism and early Christianity. The Christian New Testament asserts that the name "" Christian "" first emerged in Antioch. It was one of the four cities of the Syrian tetrapolis, and its residents were known as Antiochenes. The city was a metropolis of half a million people during Augustan times, but it declined to relative insignificance during the Middle Ages because of warfare, repeated earthquakes, and a change in trade routes, which no longer passed through Antioch from the far east following the Mongol invasions and conquests.

371,"Afonso, Prince Imperial of Brazil","Dom Afonso (23 February 1845   11 June 1847) was the Prince Imperial and heir apparent to the throne of the Empire of Brazil. Born in Rio de Janeiro, he was the eldest child of Emperor Dom Pedro  II and Dona Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies, and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza. Afonso died from epilepsy at the age of two, devastating the emperor. The following year, Pedro and Teresa Cristina had another son, Pedro Afonso, but he too died in infancy. After the loss of his second son, doubts grew in Pedro  II's mind that the imperial system could be viable. He still had an heir in his daughter Isabel, but he was unconvinced that a female would prove to be a suitable successor. He showed less concern about the effects his policies had on the monarchy, provided his daughter Isabel with no training for her role as potential empress, and failed to cultivate her acceptance within the country's political class. Pedro  II's lack of interest in protecting the imperial system ultimately led to its downfall. ","Pedro Afonso | mother | Dona Teresa Cristina

372,María de Buenos Aires,"Mara de Buenos Aires is a tango operetta (tango operita) with music by stor Piazzolla and libretto by Horacio Ferrer that premiered at the Sala Planeta in Buenos Aires on 8 May 1968. The first part of the surreal plot centers on the experiences of a prostitute in Buenos Aires, Argentina ; the second part takes place after her death. The characters include Mara (and, after her death, the Shadow of Mara), a singer of payadas ; various members of the Buenos Aires underworld ; a payador who functions as a poet and narrator ; a goblin-like duende ; several marionettes under the control of the duende ; a circus of psychoanalysts ; pasta makers ; and construction workers. Many elements of the libretto suggest parallels between Mara and Mary, the mother of Jesus (in Spanish, Mara) or Jesus himself. While certainly not in the narrow sense an opera ballet, because the dance is tango rather than classical ballet, it falls within the tradition of having set dance pieces integral to an operatic work. The music draws on the nuevo tango idiom for which Piazzolla is famous. The original idea for the story was conceived by Piazzolla's lover at the time of its composition, Egle Martin, who was married to Eduardo "" Lalo "" Palacios. The title role was originally conceived for Martin, but while Piazzolla was still composing the operita, he and Martin broke up after he asked her husband for her hand at Christmas in 1967. According to Martin, Piazzolla said to Lalo, "" She is music, she ca n't belong to anybody, no she is music, she is music, and that's me. "" After their rift, a replacement was desperately needed, but Piazzolla soon met folksinger Amelita Baltar at the Buenos Aires nightclub Nuestro Tiempo, formerly known as "" 676 "" and once Piazzolla's home base in Argentina. Baltar's identification with the character Mara, paired with her beauty and captivating stage presence, made her ideal for the role. The piece is written for at least three vocalists (one of whom, the narrator, mainly speaks rather sings). For the orchestration Piazzolla augmented his current working quintet : Piazzolla (bandonen), Antonio Agri (violin), Jamie "" El Russo "" Gosis (piano), Oscar Lopez Ruiz (guitar) and Kicho Daz (double bass) ; with viola, cello, flute, percussion, vibraphone and xylophone, and a second guitar. Mara de Buenos Aires has often been performed with dancers as well as musicians. There are several extant arrangements, including Piazzolla's own and one by Pablo Ziegler.

375,Gershonites,"The Gershonites were one of the four main divisions among the Levites in Biblical times. The Bible claims that the Gershonites were all descended from the eponymous Gershon, a son of Levi, although some biblical scholars regard this as a postdictional metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the clan to others in the Israelite confederation. The Bible ascribes a specific religious function to the Gershonites, namely care of the curtains, hangings, and ropes of the sanctuary. This differentiation of religious activity between the Gershonites and other Levites, in particular the Aaronids, is found only in the Priestly Code, and not in passages that textual scholars attribute to other authors. According to the Book of Joshua, rather than possessing a continuous territory, the Gershonites possessed several cities scattered throughout the geographic regions of Galilee and Bashan : in the territory of Manasseh : Golan, and Beeshterah in the territory of Issachar : Kishon, Dabareh, Jarmuth, and En-gannim in the territory of Asher : Mishal, Abdon, Helkath, and Rehob in the territory of Naphtali : Kedesh, Hammoth-dor, and Kartan ","Levi | present in work | Bible

377,Battle of Sio,"The Battle of Sio, fought between December 1943 and March 1944, was the break-out and pursuit phase of General Douglas MacArthur's Huon Peninsula campaign, part of the New Guinea campaign of World War II. After the defeat of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg, Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese positions around Finschhafen. Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats, Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse, resulting in disease, malnutrition, and privation for the Japanese soldiers. Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea. Australian and Papuan troops advanced along the coast of the Huon Peninsula, using infantry, tanks, and air strikes against the Japanese positions, which were generally sited at creek crossings in the jungle. The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery, which was liberally employed in the early stages of the operation. Using tactics that exploited the firepower of Australian artillery and armour, the Australian and Papuan troops inflicted heavy and disproportionate casualties on the Japanese as they advanced, ultimately linking up with the American forces at Saidor. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed ; thousands more died from disease, malnutrition, exhaustion and suicide. The Allies failed to seize the opportunity to completely destroy the Japanese forces. During the advance, Australian troops captured Japanese cryptographic materials. This had an important effect on the subsequent course of the war against Japan in the South West Pacific, as it permitted codebreakers in Australia and the United States to read Japanese Army messages on a much greater scale than previously.

378,Peters Club,"Peters Club was an Australian children's television series which reportedly debuted in 1958, and aired on GTV-9, running into 1959. At the time, many Australian TV series were only broadcast on a single station instead of being networked, which may have also been the case with the series. Cast included Rod McLennan, Judy Banks and Joff Ellen. There is very little information available on this show but it is known that the now-defunct Truth newspaper gave it an award for "" Best Children's Show-Melbourne Television "". Notably, it was produced by Crawford Productions. The title is possibly in reference to the sponsor. As was also the case with 1950s American television series, early Australian television series sometimes featured the name of the sponsor in the title. Other examples included The Dulux Show, Tarax Show, Shell Presents, Swallows Parade, The Astor Show, among others. There is no information available as to whether any episodes exist as kinescope recordings, the method used to record live television in Australia prior to the introduction of video-tape, as many live broadcasts of the era were not recorded.

The album was released on November 5, 2007 in the United Kingdom and on November 13, 2007 through Relapse Records in the US ; their last album on the label. The album is Gil Sharone's first and last album with the band and their first without founding drummer Chris Pennie. Lead guitarist Ben Weinman plays guitar alone on the record, due to Brian Benoit's injury. The album incorporates influences from electronic music. According to an interview in Terrorizer magazine, this is their last album on the Relapse Records label. The album was critically successful, debuting on the Billboard 200 at number 142 with 7,000 copies scanned, but was later corrected when it was revealed that Relapse somehow forgot to scan the pre-release album sales, which made the first week total actually around 11,000. The album features guest vocals by band's former vocalist Dimitri Minakakis (on "" Fix Your Face "") and Mastodon's Brent Hinds (on "" Horse Hunter "").

380,O. W. Coburn School of Law,"The O. W. Coburn School of Law was the law school of Oral Roberts University. The school was named after donor Orin Wesley Coburn, the founder of Coburn Optical Industries and the father of future US politician Tom Coburn. The school opened in 1979. Its founding dean was Charles Kothe, a Tulsa, Oklahoma labor attorney. Other professors included Anita Hill, John Eidsmoe, Gary Lane, Herb Titus, and Rutherford Institute founder John W. Whitehead. In 1986, the school closed, with its 190,000 volume law library, as well as 5 professors and 23 students, moving to CBN University (now Regent University). Since the new CBN law school would not initially be accredited (and in fact did not receive provisional accreditation until 1989), students graduating in spring 1987 were allowed to state they graduated from Coburn, in order to be listed as graduating from an accredited school. U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann began attending Coburn the first year it opened, and graduated as part of its last class. ","Orin Wesley Coburn | father | Tom Coburn

381,Microsoft Sync Framework,"Microsoft Sync Framework is a data synchronization platform from Microsoft that can be used to synchronize data across multiple data stores. Sync Framework includes a transport-agnostic architecture, into which data store-specific synchronization providers, modelled on the ADO.NET data provider API, can be plugged in. Sync Framework can be used for offline access to data, by working against a cached set of data and submitting the changes to a master database in a batch, as well as to synchronize changes to a data source across all consumers (publish / subscribe sync) and peer-to-peer synchronization of multiple data sources. Sync Framework features built-in capabilities for conflict detection  whether data to be changed has already been updated  and can flag them for manual inspection or use defined policies to try to resolve the conflict. Sync Services includes an embedded SQL Server Compact database to store metadata about the synchronization relationships as well as about each sync attempt. The Sync Framework API is surfaced both in managed code, for use with.NET Framework applications, as well as unmanaged code, for use with COM applications. It was scheduled to ship with Visual Studio 2008 in late November 2007. ","Microsoft Sync Framework | developer | Microsoft

383,A Bridge Too Far (book),"Cornelius Ryan's A Bridge Too Far gives an account of Operation Market Garden, a failed Allied attempt to break through German lines at Arnhem in the occupied Netherlands during World War II. The title of the book comes from a comment made by British Lieutenant General Frederick Browning, deputy commander of the First Allied Airborne Army, who told Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery before the operation, "" I think we may be going a bridge too far. "" Drawing on a wide variety of sources, Ryan also documented his account of the 1944 battle with pictures and maps and included a section on the survivors,  Soldiers and Civilians  What They Do Today . One particular focus was on the tactical mistakes made in planning the operation. Until Ryan's book, Market Garden had been a classic example of victors writing the history. Popular accounts of World War II usually tended not to mention the battle at all or put Montgomery's spin on it as being a "" partial success "". The 1974 book was published by Simon & Schuster in New York and by Hamish Hamilton in London. There were frequent later editions, and a film based on it was released in 1977.

Over 500 troops, mostly from the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, began hunting the Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters in the provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar on Afghanistan's eastern border. The operation is especially focused on the city of Jalalabad, a known al-Qaeda stronghold strategically located on the main route between the Afghan capital Kabul and Pakistan city of Peshawar. Anti-coalition forces, led by former Afghan prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, have attacked coalition forces with their usual retinue of rockets, mines, and bobby traps. Hekmatyar has been organizing alliances between the remaining anti-coalition forces in the area and increasing their coordination. In addition to hunting the Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters, Operation Unified Resolve also distributes humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people in the nearby valleys.

He is a former Tennessee State University physics professor. He is listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as part of a core group of 10 Anti-Muslim hard-liners. Warner has said that his focus is on the political aspects of Islamic doctrine related to kafirs (non-Muslims) rather than on the beliefs of contemporary Muslims. His books are based on the premise that Islam as a religion and what he refers to as Political Islam should be clearly delineated. Islam as a faith is an individual s private decision and it should be treated with respect and tolerance. Warner defines "" political Islam, "" which he also calls Islamism, "" as a belief that Islam should control society and politics, not simply personal religious life.

387,All Together Now (The Farm song),""" All Together Now "" is a song by Liverpudlian band The Farm from their album Spartacus, and links some of the band's favourite themes : socialism, brotherhood and football. Peter Hooton wrote the lyrics in his early 20s after reading about the Christmas truce of 1914. The song was first recorded under the title "" No Man's Land "" for a John Peel session in 1983. In 1990, Hooton wrote the chorus after Steve Grimes suggested putting the lyrics of No Man's Land to the chord progression of Pachelbel's Canon. To shorten the song for radio, the producer Suggs cut the song to three verses from its original six. It has been used by numerous football teams since, as well as by the Labour Party (UK) for their 2017 General Election campaign, often played during rallies.

He painted mainly in his native city, as well as in Rome, where he was active from the beginning of the 17th century until around 1640. He was employed by Pope Sixtus V in the decoration of the library of the Vatican and in the decoration of the Scala Santa in San Giovanni Laterano. In the latter, he painted, Moses striking the Rock and Moses with the Brazen Serpent. Said to have been a pupil of Federico Barocci, Lilio created a popular niche for himself by painting allegories for aristocratic audiences. In fact, it is altogether possible that Lilio collaborated for the illustrations of Cesare Ripa's Iconologia, which was a popular source for such motifs for a very long time. He died at Ascoli Piceno. In a chapel of the Chiesa Nuova, he painted The Archangel Michael driving fallen angels from Heaven. He continued to ornament churches and convents of Rome during the reign of Pope Clement VIII. One of his masterpieces, the Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence, was painted for Santa Caterina in Ancona. He painted the Christ Washing the Feet of His Disciples for the nave of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. He also was part of the team active in the painting of the Sistine chapel (chapel of Nativity) in Santa Maria Maggiore. For the cathedral of Fano, he painted a picture of All Saints. Four new allegorical paintings by Lilio were identified in Milan's Bagatti Valsecchi Museum, Milan. ","Andrea Lilio | place of birth | Ancona

German colonial forces withdrew from the capital Lom and the coastal province, to fight delaying actions on the route north to Kamina, where the Kamina Funkstation (wireless transmitter) linked the government in Berlin to Togoland, the Atlantic and South America. The main British and French force from the neighbouring colonies of Gold Coast and Dahomey, advanced from the coast up the road and railway, as smaller forces converged on Kamina from the north. The German defenders were able to delay the invaders for several days at the battles of Agbeluvhoe and Chra but surrendered the colony on 26 August 1914. In 1916, Togoland was partitioned by the victors and in July 1922, British Togoland and French Togoland were established as League of Nations mandates. ","Togoland | capital | Lomé

399,Municipal elections in Canada,"Municipal elections in Canada fall within the jurisdiction of the various provinces and territories, who usually hold their municipal elections on the same date every two, three or four years, depending on the location. Each province has its own nomenclature for municipalities and some have local elections for unincorporated areas which are not technically municipalities. These entities can be called cities, towns, villages, townships, hamlets, parishes and, simply, municipalities, county municipalities, regional county municipalities, municipal districts, regional districts, counties, regional municipalities, specialized municipalities, district municipalities or rural municipalities. Many of these may be used by Statistics Canada as the basis for census divisions or census subdivisions. Municipal elections usually elect a mayor and city council and often also a school board. Some locations may also elect other bodies, such as Vancouver, which elects its own parks board. Some municipalities will also hold referenda or ballot initiatives at the same time, usually relating to spending projects or tax changes. Elections for city councils are held through either a ward system or at-large system, depending on the location. Vancouver is the largest city in Canada to use the at-large system, while most other larger cities use wards. Most councils are non-partisan and elect only independents. However, some municipalities have locally based political parties or election slates. These include Montreal, Quebec City and Longueuil in Quebec and Vancouver, Victoria, Surrey and Richmond in British Columbia. These local parties are rarely affiliated with any provincial or federal parties. Voting may be done with paper ballots that are hand-counted, or by various forms of electronic voting.

403,Anna Karenina,"Anna Karenina () is a novel by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy, first published in book form in 1878. Many authors consider Anna Karenina the greatest work of literature ever written, and Tolstoy himself called it his first true novel. It was initially released in serial installments from 1873 to 1877 in the periodical The Russian Messenger. A complex novel in eight parts, with more than a dozen major characters, it is spread over more than 800 pages (depending on the translation), typically contained in two volumes. It deals with themes of betrayal, faith, family, marriage, Imperial Russian society, desire, and rural vs. city life. The plot centers on an extramarital affair between Anna and dashing cavalry officer Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky that scandalizes the social circles of Saint Petersburg and forces the young lovers to flee for Italy in a futile search for happiness. Returning to Russia, their lives further unravel. A second major plot line follows Levin, a character loosely based on Tolstoy himself, who rejects glitzy city life and those same social circles for his rural farm, but struggles with both his love for Kitty, who has rejected him, and with his Christian faith. Trains are a recurring motif throughout the novel, which takes place against the backdrop of rapid transformations as a result of the liberal reforms initiated by Emperor Alexander II of Russia, with several major plot points taking place either on passenger trains or at stations in Saint Petersburg or elsewhere in Russia. The novel has been adapted into various media including opera, film, television, ballet, figure skating and radio drama. The first film adaptation was released in 1911 but has not survived.

405,Henri de Buade,"Henri de Buade de Frontenac (1596  1622) was a French aristocrat during the age of Louis XIII of France, best known as the father of Louis de Buade de Frontenac, the future Lieutenant General of the colony of New France in North America. Henri de Buade de Frontenac was born in 1596, son of Antoine de Buade and Anne de Secondat. His father, from a family that originated in Guyenne, was an intimate of King Henry IV of France As a child Henri de Buade was a playmate of the future king Louis XIII. It is said that one day when King Henri IV was in poor health, he had the two boys stage a fight on his bed to amuse him. In May 1612 King Louis XIII granted him some land behind the Chteau du Louvre in Paris, then used only for a hen house, on which he could build a house. His father Antoine arranged for Henri to marry Anne Phlypeaux in 1613. Her father and uncle were Raymond Phlypeaux and Paul Phlypeaux, both secretaries of state and highly influential men. His son, Louis de Buade, Compte de Frontenac at de Pulluau, was born in 1620. King Louis XIII acted as godfather to the boy, who was named after him. Henri de Buade became a colonel in the Regiment of Navarre. He was killed in 1622 during a military campaign. His heart was removed, sealed in a lead box, and buried in the church at Palluau.

409,Pierre Le Gros the Younger,"Pierre Le Gros (12 April 1666  3 May 1719) was a French sculptor, active almost exclusively in Baroque Rome. Nowadays, his name is commonly written Legros, while he himself always signed as Le Gros ; he is frequently referred to either as ' the Younger ' or ' Pierre II ' to distinguish him from his father, Pierre Le Gros the Elder, who was also a sculptor. The "" ardent drama "" of his work and its Italian location make him more an Italian, than a French, sculptor. Despite being virtually unknown to the general public today, he was the pre-eminent sculptor in Rome for nearly two decades, until he was finally superseded at the end of his life by the more classicizing Camillo Rusconi.

The song is a ballad in praise of Portugal itself. The song is about freedom, brotherhood and hope.

It's also a love hymn from Portuguese people to their ex-colonies people, whom they had fought. The song was performed eighth on the night, following Luxembourg's Anne-Marie B. with "" Frre Jacques "" and preceding the United Kingdom's Lynsey de Paul & Mike Moran with "" Rock Bottom "".

414,Cornelis Ketel,"Cornelis or Cornelius Ketel (18 March 1548  8 August 1616) was a Dutch Mannerist painter, active in Elizabethan London from 1573 to 1581, and in Amsterdam from 1581 to the early 17th century, now known essentially as a portrait-painter, though he was also a poet and orator, and from 1595 began to sculpt as well. According to Ketel's biography, written by his contemporary Karel van Mander, he seems to have wanted to concentrate on the most prestigious of the hierarchy of genres, history painting, which included mythological subjects, but after he left France he is known almost entirely as a portrait-painter. Neither England nor Holland had much demand for large history paintings during his lifetime, and none of Ketel's histories or allegorical paintings are known to have survived intact, although drawings and prints survive. He did however significantly influence the development of the largest type of painting commonly produced in the United Provinces at this period, the civic group portrait.

420,Cassels Lake,"Cassels Lake (originally known as White Bear Lake) is a lake located within the Municipality of Temagami, in the Nipissing District, Ontario, Canada. It contains numerous portages, campsites and is one of three lakes on the eastern edge of the White Bear Forest. In the 1920s a log dam was constructed at the narrows connecting Cassels Lake and Rabbit Lake to float logs from the surrounding area out to the Ottawa River. The water level in numerous lakes close to Temagami was increased numerous feet. The Gillies ' Bros. logging company then cut the trees from the land and the flooded forest area leaving behind the snags and stumps seen in the water. The old growth white pine and red pine immediately south of the mill was never cut and remains today as the 400-year-old White Bear Forest. According to local folklore, this stand was n't cut because the wife of the mill manager wanted to look out of her home on the majestic pine forest, and so forbid him from cutting there. The White Bear Forest on the south side of the lake, opposite the former mill, is now a conservation reserve. The reserve has a system of hiking trails, which provide visitors with a great opportunity to experience the old growth pine forest.

429,Waterloo Moraine,"The Waterloo Moraine is a landform and sediment body that was created as a moraine in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, in Ontario, Canada. It covers a large portion of the cities of Waterloo and Kitchener and the township of Wilmot, and some parts of the townships of Wellesley and North Dumfries. About 90 % of the water supply of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo is derived from groundwater of the Waterloo Moraine aquifer system. During late 1989 and early 1990, groundwater contamination in Elmira forced the Region to shut down some well fields. As a result, new land use management guidelines and water protection measures have been enacted. The Waterloo Moraine is the largest of fourteen moraines in the Region, spanning approximately 400 square kilometres. It is an interlobate moraine, consisting primarily of sand and gravel. It contains large aquifers, which discharge into the Grand River and its tributaries and maintain a base water flow rate into that system.

There have been claims made that the novel was written by mystery writer Craig Rice but others have suggested that there is enough documented evidence in the form of manuscripts and correspondence to prove Lee wrote at least a large portion if not the whole of the novel herself under the tutelage of editor / friend George Davis with some essential guidance from her good friend Rice. The novel has also been published under the titles Lady of Burlesque and The Strip-Tease Murders. Set in a burlesque theater, Lee casts herself as the detective who solves a set of homicides in which strippers in her troupe are found strangled with their own G-strings.

437,Soggy biscuit,"Soggy biscuit (also known as ookie cookie, limp biscuit, wet biscuit, shoot the cookie, or cum on a cookie) is a male group masturbation activity where the participants stand around a biscuit (UK) or cookie (US) masturbating and ejaculating onto it ; the last person to do so must eat the biscuit. The game is reportedly played by adolescents, notably in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia. In Australia, it is also known as soggy Sao after the SAO brand of biscuits that are popular there. Although soggy biscuit is not necessarily associated with homosexuality, since the game does not require sexual contact, the idea and practice of the game is in keeping with the spirit of adolescent sexual exploration associated by many in the UK with public schools or in Australia with private schools. Although the terminology may differ slightly, the notability of the game is such that variations on the theme are referred to in popular culture, examples including Stephen Fry's The Liar, the German film Crazy, the 2006 film Sleeping Dogs Lie, the episode of Blackadder II "" Chains "", and the episode of Drawn Together, "" Freaks and Greeks "". According to the book Law of the Playground, 1866 men were asked : "" How close have you got to the game of soggy biscuit, in which you race to wank onto a cracker ? "" Of the respondents, 6.2 % reportedly admitted to having played the game. In November 2011, The Eagle-Tribune reported that police were investigating claims that two Andover High School (Massachusetts) basketball players were hazed by older team members into playing the game. In January 2012, it was reported that two students were expelled over the incident and a further five were suspended. A grand jury was convened to determine if any of the students should be charged criminally. ","Sleeping Dogs Lie | publication date | 2006

438,Howard the Duck (film),"Howard the Duck is a 1986 American science fiction comedy film directed by Willard Huyck and starring Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones, and Tim Robbins. Produced by Gloria Katz and written by Huyck and Katz, with George Lucas as executive producer, the screenplay was originally intended to be an animated film based on the Marvel comic book of the same name, but the film adaptation became live-action because of a contractual obligation. Although several TV adaptations of Marvel characters had aired during the preceding 21 years, this was the first theatrically released feature film, coming after the serial Captain America. Lucas proposed adapting the comic book following the production of American Graffiti (1973). Following multiple production difficulties and mixed response to test screenings, Howard the Duck was released in theaters on August 1, 1986. Upon its release, the film was a critical and commercial failure, and in the years since, was considered one of the worst films of all time. It was nominated for seven Razzie Awards, and made about $ 15 million domestically compared to its $ 30 million budget. Despite the criticism, it has gained a cult following among fans of the comic-book series. ","Howard the Duck | publication date | 1986

441,List of National Football League quarterback playoff records,"The first official National Football League (NFL) playoff game was the 1933 NFL Championship Game between the Chicago Bears and New York Giants. A "" playoff "" game was played in 1932 between the Chicago Bears and Portsmouth Spartans to break a regular season tie, but is recorded in the team record books as a regular season game. Since then there have been a total over 525 NFL playoff games including games from the AFL, but not the AAFC. The following list shows career postseason records for each starting quarterback in the NFL playoffs. Wins or losses are credited to the quarterback who started the game for each team, even if he was injured or failed to complete the game. While many players have won playoff games for two teams, only two have won a championship for different franchises. Tobin Rote was quarterback for the NFL champion 1957 Lions and the AFL champion 1963 Chargers. Peyton Manning was the quarterback for 2006 Colts and the 2015 Broncos. Note : from 19331949 some offenses did not employ a quarterback in the modern sense of the position. Listed below are the "" primary passers "" for those games, the players that passed the ball most in those games. They may not have actually started the game at quarterback. This format allows Hall of Fame quarterbacks like Sid Luckman and Sammy Baugh to maintain credit for their team's playoff records since they were obviously the top passer for their team.

446,Léon la lune,"Lon la lune () is a 1956 French short documentary film directed by Alain Jessua. The film won the Prix Jean Vigo in 1957. The film documents an old drifter in Paris in the poetic realist style. Jessua was inspired by Jean-Paul Clbert's book Paris Insolite (1952) and decided to make a film about a clochard or tramp. The poet and novelist Robert Giraud, an expert on the Parisian underworld, introduced Jessua to Lon la Lune, a vagrant whose real name was Leon Boudeville, and suggested that they follow him from day to night. After completing the film Giraud showed it to the poet and screenwriter Jacques Prvert who wrote an introduction and asked Henri Crolla to contribute some music to the film. Lon la lune also appeared in the series Clochards by Robert Doisneau, the pioneer of humanist photojournalism. ","Paris Insolite | publication date | 1952

454,Franz Wilhelm Seiwert,"Franz Wilhelm Seiwert (March 9, 1894  July 3, 1933) was a German painter and sculptor in a constructivist style. He was also politically active as a communist making significant contributions, both graphic and theoretical to Die Aktion. Seiwert was born in Cologne. He was seriously burned in 1901, at the age of seven, in an experimental radiological treatment. As a result, he subsequently lived with the fear that his life would be short. He studied from 1910 to 1914 at the Cologne School of Arts and Crafts. In 1919 he met Max Ernst and took part in Dada activities. He was invited to exhibit in the large Dada exhibit in Cologne but withdrew at the last moment. In that same year he formed the Stupid group which included Heinrich Hoerle and Anton Rderscheidt. According to Ernst, "" Stupid was a secession from Cologne Dada. As far as Hoerle and especially Seiwert were concerned, Dada's activities were aesthetically too radical and socially not concrete enough "". His first large solo exhibition was in Cologne at the Kunstverein in 1923, and by the mid-1920s he was a leader of the "" Group of Progressive Artists "", who sought to reconcile constructivism with realism while expressing radical political views. In 1929 he founded the magazine "" a-z "", a journal of progressive art. This became a vehicle for the exposition of Figurative Constructivism. ","Franz Wilhelm Seiwert | place of birth | Cologne

460,Royal Arsenal,"The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich carried out armaments manufacture, ammunition proofing, and explosives research for the British armed forces at a site on the south bank of the River Thames in Woolwich in south-east London, England, United Kingdom. It was originally known as the Woolwich Warren, having begun on land previously used as a domestic warren in the grounds of a Tudor house, Tower Place. Much of the initial history of the site is linked with that of the Board of Ordnance, which purchased the Warren in the late 17th century in order to expand an earlier base at Gun Wharf in Woolwich Dockyard. Over the next two centuries, as operations grew and innovations were pursued, the site expanded massively ; at the time of the First World War the Arsenal covered and employed close to 80,000 people. Thereafter its operations were scaled down ; it finally closed as a factory in 1967 and the Ministry of Defence moved out in 1994. Today the area, so long a secret enclave, is open to the public and is being redeveloped for housing and community use. ","London | located in the administrative territorial entity | England

468,New Haven Harbor,"New Haven Harbor is an inlet on the north side of Long Island Sound in the state of Connecticut in the United States.

The city of New Haven and its neighborhoods of City Point, Long Wharf, The Annex, and East Shore lie on the northern and eastern sides. West Haven is on the west. The Quinnipiac and Mill rivers converge and empty into the inlet on its north end. The Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge crosses here. The West River empties into the western end of the harbor (also known as West Haven Harbor). The harbor is protected from Long Island Sound by a peninsula on its eastern side, once known as "" Little Necke "" but now called Lighthouse Point, because of the lighthouse that was constructed on its tip in 1805. The original lighthouse was replaced in 1845 by the current structure, called the Five Mile Point Lighthouse. This lighthouse was replaced for navigation in 1877 by the offshore Southwest Ledge Light. Sperry Lighthouse (1899  1933) also served the harbor. In July 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, the peninsula was the scene of an amphibious landing by British troops. The harbor is circumnavigable via the partially completed "" Harborside Greenway "" bicycle and pedestrian trail, which is part of the East Coast Greenway system.

481,Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum,"The Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum () was a ceremonial tomb on Prince Alexander of Battenberg Square in Sofia, Bulgaria, from 1949 to 1999. The white marble mausoleum was built in 1949 to contain the embalmed body of Bulgaria's first Communist leader, Georgi Dimitrov (1882  1949), construction beginning immediately after the news of Dimitrov's death. It was completed in just six days, the time it took Dimitrov's body to be returned to Sofia from the USSR. Dimitrov's body remained in the mausoleum until August 1990, when Dimitrov's remains were cremated and the ashes buried in the Sofia's Central Cemetery. The mausoleum itself was destroyed by Prime Minister Ivan Kostov's UDF government in 1999 after a heated nationwide debate. The prime minister and his party claimed that retaining the mausoleum was inappropriate following the fall of Communism in 1989 because it represented Bulgaria's repressive past. Even within the government there was opposition to destroying the building, and an opinion poll revealed that two-thirds of the population opposed the demolition. Proposals were made to turn the mausoleum into a museum or art gallery because it contributed to the unique atmosphere of the capital city. In August 1999, the government made four attempts to demolish the building. The first three failed because they relied on a single powerful explosion. The building did not budge after the first two attempts and tilted only slightly after the third. The fourth (and successful) attempt was carried out using a series of consecutive, less powerful explosions. ","Battenberg Square | country | Bulgaria

On the east shore (from north to south) are the town of Topsham, the villages of Exton and Lympstone and at the estuary mouth, the seaside resort of Exmouth. Opposite Exmouth on the west shore is the village of Dawlish Warren with its sand spit extending across the mouth of the estuary. Above this there are fewer settlements on the west shore, with just the villages of Starcross and Cockwood, both adjoining the lower portion of the estuary. The River Clyst also feeds into the estuary, just below Topsham. The River Kenn feeds into the estuary near Kenton. The soil is alluvial, derived from Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian rocks.

484,Contact Group (Balkans),"The Contact Group is the name for an informal grouping of great powers that have a significant interest in policy developments in the Balkans. The Contact Group is composed of United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia. It was first created in response to the war and the crisis in Bosnia in the early 1990s. The Contact Group includes four of the five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council and the countries that contribute the most in troops and assistance to peacebuilding efforts in the Balkans. Representatives of the EU Council, EU Presidency, European Commission and NATO generally attend Contact Group meetings. The Contact Group has taken a major interest in the UN-led process to determine the future political status of Kosovo and Metohija (i.e., whether it should be independent or remain a part of Serbia). The Contact Group meets regularly with UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari, who has been charged with running the future status process. The Contact Group has no Secretariat or permanent staff  it is simply an informal grouping of countries that meets regularly at various levels to coordinate international policy initiatives in southeast Europe. Contact Group public statements, often negotiated to painstaking detail within the group, are considered to be significant statements of the international community's policy and intentions in the region. The Contact Group usually meets at the level of Balkans director (i.e., the highest-ranking diplomats in charge of the Balkans in each foreign ministry). Occasionally, however, the Contact Group meets at the level of Political Director or even Foreign Minister. ","UN Security Council | part of | UN

Thought to have formed during the early Eocene with the opening of the Drake Passage that separates South America from Antarctica, it is a minor plate whose movement is largely controlled by the two major plates that surround it : the South American plate and Antarctic plate. Roughly rhomboid, extending between and, the plate is wide and long. It is moving WSW at /year and the South Sandwich Plate is moving east at /year in an absolute reference frame. It takes its name from the steam yacht Scotia of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (1902  04), the expedition that made the first bathymetric study of the region. The Scotia Plate is made of oceanic crust and continental fragments now distributed around the Scotia Sea. Before the formation of the plate began (40Ma), these fragments formed a continuous landmass from Patagonia to the Antarctic Peninsula along an active subduction margin. At present the plate is almost completely submerged, with only the small exceptions of the South Georgia Islands on its northeastern edge and the southern tip of South America.

486,Revulsion (Star Trek: Voyager),""" Revulsion "" is the 73rd episode of, the fifth episode of the. This is focused on an EMH (The Doctor)-like hologram on another ship, which is dealt with mostly by the Doctor and B'Elanna. In addition, sub-plots run their course on Voyager with other characters. Guest star Leland Orser plays the EMH-like hologram Dejaren on a spaceship that is encountered by Voyager. Leland Orser had also played a character on Deep Space Nine. The episode, in retrospect, was noted for a possible allusion to male sexual abuse via the hologram. In contrast to historical examples in Trek history, like Bajoran comfort women, the character of Dejaren has been compared to Gigolo Joe from Spielberg's 2001 film A.I.. However, this may be too broad an interpretation of the episode noting a more basic horror film element. The episode is noted as playing homage to the tradition of "" trashy science fiction horror "" vibe in the Star Trek universe as portrayed by episodes like "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" Dark Page "", "" "", "" "", "" "" or "" "".

It features the single "" Bright Yellow Gun "", the band's first national hit. The album's radio exposure led to feature articles in Rolling Stone and other major music magazines. The album was recorded in the fall of 1993, right before lead Muse Kristin Hersh recorded her first solo album, Hips and Makers. 4AD founder and president Ivo Watts-Russell convinced Hersh to release the solo album first, in early 1994. This led to this album being delayed until 1995. Despite all the positive notices and exposure for the album, sales were disappointingly low, and the band was dropped from Sire's roster, ending the Muses ' major label years. The band has continued sporadically ever since, releasing two more albums on the independent 4AD, one in 1996 and one in 2003, before releasing 2013's Purgatory / Paradise on their own label.

Nearby is Endview Plantation, a 238-year-old house. Endview was used as a hospital during the Civil War and as a campground during the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812 and the Civil War.

491,Phyllonorycter issikii,"The lime leaf miner (Phyllonorycter issikii) is a moth of the Gracillariidae family. It is native to Japan, Korea and eastern Russia, but was probably introduced to eastern Europe around 1970. It is now widespread in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and is expanding its range in Hungary and Germany. It has also been recorded from the Baltic states and also the Benelux in 2009. The wingspan is 7-7.5  mm. Adults are on wing from the end of June to mid-July and from the end of July to the end of August in two generations. The larvae feed on Tilia americana, Tilia cordata and Tilia platyphyllos. They mine the leaves of their host plant. They create a lower-surface, somewhat contracted tentiform mine. There are often several mines in a single leaf. The frass is concentrated in a corner of the mine, recognisable from above as a black patch. ","Hungary | continent | Europe
