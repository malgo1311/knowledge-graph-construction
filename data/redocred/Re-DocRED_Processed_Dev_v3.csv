5,Song of Freedom,"Song of Freedom is a 1936 British film directed by J. Elder Wills and starring Paul Robeson. One of two elements pivotal to the plot is an opera composer named Gabriel Donizetti, presumably suggested by the historical opera composer Gaetano Donizetti. The other is a medallion that serves to identify Robeson's character as a descendant of an African monarch. Song of Freedom may best represent the opportunity Robeson was looking for to "" give a true picture of many aspects of the life of the coloured man in the West. Hitherto on the screen, he has been characterized or presented only as a comedy character. This film shows him as a real man. "" Robeson was also given final cut approval on the film, an unprecedented option at the time for an actor of any race. As in Sanders of the River, the film called for documentary scenes of West African traditional dances and ceremonies, but this time Robeson obtained a contract giving him final cut, so that the film s message would not be changed behind the doors of the editing room. Robeson plays Zinga, a black dockworker in England with a great baritone singing voice. He is discovered by an opera impresario, and is catapulted into great fame as an international opera star. Yet he feels alienated from his African past, and out of place in England. By chance, he is informed that an ancestral medallion that he wears is proof of his lineage to African kings, and he leaves fame and fortune to take his rightful place of royalty. Reunited with his people, he plans to improve their lives by combining the best of western technology with the best of traditional African ways. Although the film was not a box office success in the US, it was notably chosen in 1950 to open the convention of Ghana's Convention People's Party. The ceremonies were presided over by the future first prime minister of independent Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, Robeson's friend from his London years. ","Convention People's Party | country | Ghana

11,Mola di Bari,"Mola di Bari, commonly referred to simply as Mola (Barese :), is a town and comune of the Metropolitan City of Bari, in the region of Apulia, in Southern Italy, on the Adriatic Sea. In recent times, the town was best known for having primarily whitewashed buildings, however, growth, modern construction, and building design have changed the image significantly, particularly in the northern (and more modern) part of the town. Mola's city center is its main piazza, Piazza XX Settembre near the port and it also boasts a church (Chiesa Matrice, i.e. Mother Church) dating back to the 13thcentury. Bakeries in Mola are known for their focaccia food. Until the early 1990s, there were two privately owned public firewood ovens available to the inhabitants of Mola, one located on Via Nino Bixio, on the southern part of the town, and the other located on Via Pesce, on the opposite side of the main Piazza. These businesses served the local residents by providing a place to cook baked goods, primarily focaccia and breads. Typically, focaccia pans were quite large (some approaching half a meter in diameter) and were difficult to cook in one s home. The tradition of sending items to be baked by the local oven has passed. Mola is also home to a large fishing industry that supplies fresh fish throughout the southern Italian region.

13,Edward Rowan Finnegan,"Edward Rowan Finnegan (June 5, 1905  February 2, 1971) was a U.S. Representative from Illinois from 1961 to 1964. Finnegan was born in Chicago and graduated with a BA from Loyola University Chicago and a law degree from the DePaul University School of Law in 1930. He started practicing as an attorney in 1931 and then served as an Assistant State's attorney in Cook County. Later, Finnegan served as the Assistant Corporation Counsel for Chicago. Finnegan unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for the position of a Chicago municipal court judge in 1939. In 1960, Finnegan was elected to Congress from Illinois ' 12th district. After redistricting, Finnegan's district was merged with the neighboring 9th District of fellow Democrat Sidney Yates. Finnegan transferred to the 9th, since Yates was giving up his seat to run for the United States Senate. Yates lost, and Chicago's machine bosses persuaded Finnegan to stand down in 1964 and hand the 9th back to Yates. In return for his co-operation, Finnegan was appointed as a judge for the Circuit Court of Cook County. He resigned his seat in Congress on December 6, 1964 and commenced his service on the bench the following day. He continued to serve until his death in 1971.

14,Foix (river),"The Foix () is a river in Catalonia in the province of Barcelona, northeastern Spain. Its source is near La Llacuna in the Comarca of Anoia 800 m above the sea. Later it runs through the Comarca of Alt Peneds, where it feeds a reservoir in the nature reserve of Parc del Foix since 1928, which is highly important for the drinking water supply of the densely populated coastal plain between Barcelona and Tarragona. Then it goes through the Comarca of Garraf from north to the south where it ends into the Mediterranean Sea west of the village of Cubelles. This little delta became an important natural reserve and recreational area after the campground Camping Paradiso was removed in the late 1990s. For most of the year, the river is dried up because of the dam and because of hot-summer climatical reasons. That can suddenly change in the winter months when heavy rain comes down in the mountains.

19,Railroad Revival Tour,"The Railroad Revival Tour was an annual music tour that featured popular roots, folk, country, rock, bluegrass and Americana acts that began in 2011. The musicians travel between shows across the American Southwest in a dozen or so vintage train cars from the 1950s and 1960s. The outdoor concert locations, sometimes attracting over 10,000 fans, are often a stone's throw from the train. The bands eat, sleep and engage in impromptu jam sessions on the train between stops, giving them a chance to collaborate. On stage at night, they often join in on each other's sets, sometimes bringing around 30 musicians up to create a rare and rowdy performance. The organic American roots feeling of the tour also prompts participating musicians to honor U.S. railway history, like Mumford & Sons ' tribute to Woody Guthrie in 2011. The inaugural tour in 2011 included performances by Mumford & Sons, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and Old Crow Medicine Show. A documentary of this first year, called Big Easy Express, directed by Emmett Malloy premiered at SXSW 2012 and won a Grammy Award in 2013. The film is currently available on iTunes and DVD / Blu-ray Disc. In 2011, Railroad Revival Tour bands Mumford & Sons, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and Old Crow Medicine Show together closed their shows at every stop with "" This Train. "" The 2012 tour was slated to include performances by Willie Nelson, Band of Horses, Jamey Johnson, and John Reilly and Friends. However, the tour was cancelled for 2012.

20,Australia–Chile Free Trade Agreement,"The Australia  Chile Free Trade Agreement is a trade agreement between the countries of Chile and Australia. It was signed on July 30, 2008 and went into effect in the 1st quarter of 2009. The agreement was intended to go into effect on January 1, 2009, but was delayed due to Chile not being able to finish its ratification in time. Trade between Chile and Australia is modest, involving $ 856 m in 2007. Australia is the fourth largest provider of foreign direct investment in Chile with over $ 3 billion in 2007. Chile ranks as Australia's 41st trading partner. Australia's main exports to Chile were coal ($ 94 million) and civil engineering equipment ($ 21 million). Trade from Chile is copper ($ 96 million), and pulp and waste paper ($ 57 million). When enacted, the Agreement calls for Chile to eliminate tariffs on 91.9 % of tariffs which cover 96.9 % of trade from Australia. Australia will cut 90.8 % of tariffs which cover 97.1 % of trade from Chile. By year six of the Agreement (2015), all tariffs will be discarded except for Chile's sugar tariff which will remain subject to its current  price band system. The tariffs in Australia, that will stay in place until 2015, will be relating to textile and the clothing industry along with table grapes. In Chile, the agreement will protect the textile and clothing industry and some other manufactured products. According to the Australian Government, the government hopes to use the Agreement as a model for other free trade agreements with other countries. Before passage of the Agreement farmers and horticulturists protested the Agreement in front of the Australian Parliament. The protesters claim that this agreement would undercut Australian food producers by allowing in cheap food goods from Chile. Simon Crean, Australia's Minister for Trade, responded to the farmers concerns by stating that tariffs are quite low or in some cases nonexistent due to previous international trade agreements. Chile and Australia agreed in principle to start negotiations on December 8, 2006. Negotiations started on July 18, 2007 and after four rounds of talks, concluded on May 27, 2008.

23,Manon Balletti,"Manon Balletti (1740  1776) was the daughter of Italian actors performing in France and lover of the famous womanizer Giacomo Casanova. She was ten years old when she first met him ; she happened to be the daughter of Silvia Balletti, an actress of the Comdie Italienne company and younger sister of Casanova's closest friend. The lovers started their relationship when Casanova was thirty-two years old and Manon was seventeen. (Although Manon's mother was associated with acting, considered disreputable at the time, mother and daughter were observed by Casanova to be of a "" pure nature "".) She wrote forty-two letters full of love and deep feelings for him ; a well-known quote from these letters describes Casanova as : "" My lover, my husband, my friend "". Casanova's sexual passions caused him to be unfaithful, causing their three-year relationship to have numerous ups and downs. Yet she continued to share his home, found in Rue du Petit-Lion-St. Sauveur. Manon was at the time engaged to her clavichord teacher, but broke it off at Casanova's request, thus starting a new engagement with him. This did not keep him from having various sexual relations with other women, yet Manon remained faithful to him. His memoirs record his regret for being unkind to her when having these affairs. Once Casanova was imprisoned after he was sued by creditors in Paris. Manon sent a pair of diamond earrings with which she bought him out. Subsequently she ended the engagement and returned his portrait and letters. Manon married the architect Jacques-Franois Blondel a short while after, disappointing Casanova, who believed that he would one day be able to settle down with her. Manon died at the age of 36, questionably from pulmonary hypertension. Casanova wrote in his memoirs that he believed his behavior shortened her life.

24,Pittsburgh Catholic,"The Pittsburgh Catholic is the weekly Catholic newspaper for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, published for lay people and priests. It labels itself as the oldest Catholic newspaper in continuous publication. The newspaper was established in 1844 by Pittsburgh's first bishop, Michael O'Connor. According to its website, the Catholic has a total market of 111,250 Catholics. The Catholic is available for free at most churches and Catholic outlets or centers in the Diocese of Pittsburgh, as churches purchase the newspaper in bulk for 21 cents per copy. Articles include news about events occurring throughout the diocese, articles on local diocesan schools, features on community and charity programs orchestrated by local Catholic organizations, reviews and commentary on contemporary media, question-and-answer forums by priests to explain church doctrine, and editorials on Church issues. The former Bishop of Pittsburgh, Donald Wuerl, was generally seen as a conservative bishop. As a result, the Pittsburgh Catholic is a conservative publication as well. However, because the newspaper is oriented towards the local region, it rarely contains extensive commentary on national issues. According to the Pittsburgh Business Times Book of Lists, the Pittsburgh Catholic is the largest weekly publication in western Pennsylvania and the second-largest newspaper in western Pennsylvania. The Pittsburgh Catholic is a member of the Catholic Press Association. Its general manager, Robert P. Lockwood, was nominated as finalist for the association's annual St. Francis de Sales Award.

27,Nexus Q,"Nexus  Q is a discontinued digital media player developed by Google. Unveiled at the Google I / O developers ' conference on June 2012, the device was expected to be released to the public in the United States shortly thereafter for US$ 300. The Nexus Q was designed to leverage Google's online media offerings, such as Google Play Music, Google Play Movies & TV, and YouTube, to provide a "" shared "" experience. Users could stream content from the supported services to a connected television, or speakers connected to an integrated amplifier, using their Android device and the services ' respective apps as a remote control for queueing content and controlling playback. The Nexus  Q received mixed reviews from critics following its unveiling. While its unique spherical design was praised, the Nexus Q was criticized for its lack of functionality in comparison to similar devices such as Apple TV, including a lack of third-party content services, no support for streaming content directly from other devices using the DLNA standard, as well as other software issues that affected the usability of the device. The unclear market positioning of the Nexus Q was also criticized, as it carried a significantly higher price than competing media players with wider capabilities ; The New York Times technology columnist David Pogue described the device as being ' wildly overbuilt ' for its limited functions. The Nexus  Q was given away at no cost to attendees of Google I / O 27-29 June 2012, but the product's consumer launch was postponed in July 2012, purportedly to collect additional feedback. Those who had pre-ordered the Nexus  Q following its unveiling received the device at no cost. The Nexus  Q was quietly shelved in January 2013, and support for the device in the Google Play apps was phased out beginning in May 2013. Some of the Nexus  Q's concepts were repurposed for a more-successful device known as Chromecast, which similarly allows users to wirelessly queue content for playback using functions found in supported apps, but is designed as a smaller HDMI dongle with support for third-party services.

29,The Christian Manifesto,""" Direction of Endeavor for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China "", commonly known as "" The Christian Manifesto "" or "" The Three-Self Manifesto "", was a political manifesto of Protestants in China whereby they backed the newly-founded People's Republic of China (PRC) and the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Published in 1950, the manifesto paved the way for the government-controlled Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) of Protestants. This movement proclaimed the three principles of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. The drafting and content of the manifesto was, and remains, controversial to this day. The manifesto was devised after Protestant leaders presented their concerns with religious freedom to Zhou Enlai, the Premier of China. Instead of receiving their report, Zhou demanded them to come up with a statement in support of the new communist leadership. Y. T. Wu and other leftist clergymen espoused the task and presented a draft manifesto that, after some opposition and changes, became a foundational text of Christianity in the new People's Republic. It condemns missionary activities in China as a form of imperialism, pledges loyalty to the communist leadership, and encourages the Church to take up an indigenous Chinese stance toward Christianity. Published on the front page of the People's Daily, the manifesto was accompanied by a campaign to gather signatures. Many Christian leaders and laymen signed, while others refused to do so. After the Korean War broke out, the campaign became an increasingly politicized test of loyalty that became merged with the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries. Some view the manifesto as a betrayal of the Church, while others find sympathy for the position of Chinese Christians struggling to reconcile their faith with the changed political realities.

30,Joseph in Islam,"Ysuf ibn Yaqb ibn Is-q ibn Ibrhm () is a Nabi (, Prophet) mentioned in the Qurn, the scripture of Islam, and corresponds to Joseph (son of Jacob), a person from the Tanakh, the Jewish religious scripture, and the Christian Bible, who was estimated to have lived in the 16th century BCE. It is one of the common names in the Middle East and among Muslim nations. Of all of Jacob's children, Joseph was the one given the gift of prophecy. Although the narratives of other prophets are mentioned in various Surahs, the complete narrative of Joseph is given only in one Surah, Yusuf, making it unique. It is said to be the most detailed narrative in the Qur'an and bears more details than the Biblical counterpart. Yusuf is believed to have been the eleventh son of Yaqb (, Jacob), and, according to many scholars, his favorite. According to Ibn Kathir, "" Jacob had twelve sons who were the eponymous ancestors of the tribes of the Israelites. The noblest, the most exalted, the greatest of them was Joseph. "" The story begins with Joseph revealing a ru'ya (, ' dream ' or ' vision ') to his father, which Jacob recognizes. In addition to the role of God in his life, the story of Yusuf and Zulaikha (Potiphar's wife of the Old Testament) became a popular subject in Persian literature, where it became considerably elaborated over the centuries. More recently, and relying on the Quran and Muslim, Christian and Jewish scholarly sources, Yusuf's story has been depicted in a 45-part TV series (originally in Persian but also dubbed in multiple other languages).

31,List of Prime Ministers of Thailand,"The Prime Minister of Thailand is the head of government of the Kingdom of Thailand. The prime minister is also the chairman of the cabinet of Thailand and represents the government at home and the country abroad. The post of prime minister has existed since 1932, after a bloodless revolution forced the absolutist King Prajadhipok to grant for the people of Siam their first constitution. Under the newly established constitutional monarchy, the first prime minister of Siam was Phraya Manopakorn Nititada. At first, the office was called the President of the People's Committee, it was later changed to Prime Minister of Siam when the king deemed it too communistic. Constitutionally the prime minister is required to be a member of the lower house of the National Assembly (the House of Representatives). He must also gain their approval through a resolution before an official appointment by the king can take place. As a result, the prime minister might succumb to a vote of no confidence and removal in the House. However, this has never happened up to date. Throughout the post's existence it has mostly been occupied by military leaders from the Royal Thai Army, three holding the rank of field marshal and seven the rank of general. The post of prime minister is currently held by General Prayut Chan-o-cha, who was formally appointed to the office on 24 August 2014. Previously he was the de facto head of government as leader of the National Council for Peace and Order, since the coup d'tat on 22 May 2014.

36,Ramada (shelter),"In the southwestern United States, a ramada is a temporary or permanent shelter equipped with a roof but no walls, or only partially enclosed. Ramadas have traditionally been constructed with branches or bushes by aboriginal Americans living in the region (deriving from the Spanish rama, meaning "" branch ""). However, the term today is also applied to permanent concrete, wooden, or steel structures used to shelter objects or people from the sun. For example, public parks in desert areas of the United States may contain ramadas with picnic tables, restrooms, water sources, etc. Since sunlight is more of an environmental hazard than wind or snow or rain in this part of the world, a roof alone provides substantial shelter. And because there are no walls in the structure, airflow is unrestricted, helping to keep the temperature below the roof substantially cooler than ambient. An example of a large modern-day ramada can be seen at the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument in Arizona, where it is used to protect ancient ruins.

40,Two Doors Down,""" Two Doors Down "" was a song written and performed by Dolly Parton, which provided a 1978 U.S. country and pop hit for her. The song was sung from the perspective of a woman who has just broken up with her boyfriend and is debating attending a party two doors down the hall from her apartment. She decides to go, meets a new man and returns with him to her own apartment "" two doors down "". It was included on Parton's 1977 Here You Come Again album, but before Parton could release it as the album's second single in March 1978, singer Zella Lehr released a cover version that became a top ten U.S. country hit. While Lehr's version was on the country charts, the title cut of Here You Come Again was becoming a much bigger pop hit than Parton had anticipated. Wanting to capitalize on her newfound pop success (and also not wanting to compete with Lehr's country version of the song) Parton rerecorded a more loose, pop-oriented version of "" Two Doors Down "" with a slight disco flavoring. She released the new version on a double-A-sided single, with the other side, "" It's All Wrong, but It's All Right "" intended for country airplay, and "" Two Doors Down "" intended for the pop airplay. The single topped the U.S. country charts, and was a top-20 pop hit for Parton, and went on to be one of her most popular hits. Also in 1978 Joe Thomas did his own disco cover of this song. Parton also had the new version of "" Two Doors Down "" (which omitted the first verse, and included an upbeat "" sing-along "" bridge) replace the previous version on all subsequent pressings of Here You Come Again, making the earlier version something of a collectors ' item among Parton's fans. The original version of "" Two Doors Down "" was subsequently issued on CD in 2000 on the 3-CD Australian compilation Legendary Dolly Parton, which is now out of print. In 2009, Jill Johnson recorded the song on the cover album Music Row II. ","Here You Come Again | performer | Dolly Parton

41,Think Bike,"The Think Bike Campaign was started by biking enthusiasts in South Africa, and is run by bikers, in the interests of road safety and public awareness. Many motorcycle accidents happen because of a lack of awareness of the issues among the general motoring public. The aim of the campaign is to correct that through the use of stickers, leaflets, and information distributed in other ways. During 2005, a number of bikers were using an online forum to discuss the alarming number of unnecessary motorcycle accidents ; avoidable accidents caused by inattentiveness, ignorance, incompetence and failure to exercise due care. The Think Bike sticker campaign started by Tony Day of Cape Town in the 1980s, and its short life were discussed, and it was decided then and there to revive the campaign and expand on its goals and methods. The campaign, while strongest in the Gauteng province, has representation in Western Cape, KwaZulu Natal and the Free State. It has dozens of trained marshals available for various events such as cycle races and is deeply involved in numerous other projects, such as the annual Toy Run. A number of studies have been done in the past, most notably in the United States and United Kingdom, that show that an alarming number of motorcycle accidents are directly caused by other vehicles. Being as vulnerable as they are, bikers very often emerge from these avoidable accidents seriously injured, maimed or dead. The campaign is also aimed at the biking community, to educate about safety issues and encourage the use of protective clothing. The Hurt Report, published in the United States in 1981, showed some alarming trends. More than 900 motorcycle accidents were investigated in the Los Angeles area, and the results showed that : Approximately three fourths of motorcycle accidents involve collision with another vehicle, usually a passenger automobile. In these accidents, the driver of the other vehicle violated the motorcycle right of way and caused the accident in two thirds of cases. The failure of motorists to detect and recognise motorcycles in traffic is the predominating cause of motorcycle accidents. The driver of the other vehicle involved in collision with the motorcycle did not see the motorcycle before the collision or did not see the motorcycle until too late to avoid the collision.

42,United States Naval Forces Germany,"United States Naval Forces Germany (NAVFORGER) was a command of the United States Navy, active from 1944 to 1958. It also had the designation Task Force 104 (TF-104). NAVFORGER was responsible for all US naval activities in Germany. Its first commander was Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley (1944  45). After the formation of the command, it was first necessary to take under U.S. control the German warships assigned to the U.S. as war prizes (for example, the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen). To this end, in Bremerhaven, a Naval Service Unit (MDG) was established. After the initial, purely administrative order, the settlement of the German Kriegsmarine and the merchant navy was in cooperation with the other allies, finished, the command was greatly reduced. It was intended to completely dissolve the command in 1948. However, the American military governor General Lucius D. Clay and since July 1948 COMNAVFORGER Rear Admiral Wilkes convinced the leadership in Washington to leave some naval forces in Germany. The now allotted backup and reconnaissance tasks were to deal with three main elements : the Naval Advanced Base Bremerhaven, the Rhine River Patrol and the Intelligence Unit stationed in Berlin. The tasks also included the supervision and management of commercial shipping on the inland waters of the United States Zone. ","Germany | ethnic group | German

43,Cry for Help,""" Cry for Help "" is the title of the first single taken from British dance-pop singer Rick Astley's third studio album, Free. It was written by Rick Astley and Rob Fisher. The Andra Crouch Choir provided backing vocals. Released as a single in January 1991, "" Cry for Help "" reached number seven on both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100. It also reached number four in Canada and was a number-one hit on both the US and Canadian Adult Contemporary charts. The song's number-seven UK chart placing meant that Astley became the first male solo artist to have his first eight singles reach the British top 10. The song is a soul ballad, unlike Astley's other more dance-oriented hit singles such as "" Never Gon na Give You Up "". It was co-written by British singer Rob Fisher, formerly one half of the 1980s pop outfits Naked Eyes and Climie Fisher. To date, the song was Astley's last appearance in the top 10 in either the US or UK. The song has been sung by Rick Astley in duet with Soren Sko and covered by Thomas Anders (ex-Modern Talking).

44,Surreal (song),""" Surreal "" (stylized as "" SURREAL "") is a song by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki, taken from her third studio album Duty (2000). It was written by Hamasaki and produced by Max Matsuura. The song is a rock with elements of alternative rock. "" Surreal "" describes Hamasaki's madness and sense of confusion, while the themes of "" Surreal "" are based on Hamasaki's concept of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities, aimed mostly toward her public image as a recording artist. It was released as the fourth single from the album on 27 September 2000 by Avex Trax and Avex Taiwan. Critical reception towards "" Surreal "" has been positive ; the majority of critics commended the songwriting and musical delivery, and highlighted it as an album and career standout.

"" Surreal "" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 250,000 units. Released as a DVD Single in December 2000, it reached number three on the Oricon DVD Chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Wataru Takeishi, featuring Hamasaki walking along a beach front. With mysterious lighting hovering over several objects, she enters a jungle-like room to find a clone of herself ; the clone wears the same outfit for the Duty and "" Surreal "" photo shoot. "" Surreal "" has been included on several concert tours and New Year Countdown shows held and hosted by Hamasaki, and has featured on majority of her greatest hits compilations.

45,Between Five and Seven,"Between Five and Seven is as the name suggests, the sixth studio album by folk singer-songwriter John Gorka. It was released in August 1996. It is the last of the five albums Gorka recorded for Windham Hill / High Street Records before returning to the smaller, Red House label. Gorka produced the album with John Jennings who also produced Gorka's previous record, Out of the Valley. Unlike the previous record made in Nashville, Tennessee, the recording was done at Paisley Park Studios, Chanhassen, Minnesota and the instrumentation has been described as "" more acoustic, less pop-oriented. "" Paisley Park is southwest of Minneapolis and is the studio designed and owned by the artist, Prince. The album includes several lyrical portraits of Gorka's misfit characters, love songs, and philosophical musings. The songs are also full of the wordplay for which Gorka has become known. The album features an impressive array of supporting musicians. Lucy Kaplansky and Jennifer Kimball add carefully placed harmony vocals to many tracks. John Jennings also brings along several other members of Mary Chapin Carpenter's band including drummer Robbie Magruder, guitarist Dean Magraw, and pianist Jonathan Carroll. Gorka's fellow Minnesotan Peter Ostroushko sits in on mandolin. As with many of Gorkas recordings Michael Manring plays fretless bass on nearly half of the songs. The tracks alternate between two different sets of instrumentalists which varies the pace of the music. The two bass players styles are distinct enough for the listener to recognize the difference.

50,Enasa,"ENASA (Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A.) was a Spanish vehicle manufacturing company, incorporated in 1946 having bought the automotive assets of the Spanish arm of Hispano-Suiza. It produced trucks, buses and military armored vehicles under the Pegaso and, for a short while, Sava brands. Enasa belonged to the state-owned INI industrial holding. From 1983 Enasa also owned Seddon Atkinson, which it received from International Harvester as compensation for a planned engine plant which had failed to materialize. International Harvester pulled out as the market for truck engines was contracting at the time, while there were also problems with Spain's admittance to the European Economic Community (EEC). In 1990 Enasa was sold to Iveco. ","ENASA | inception | 1946

51,Christian worship,"In Christianity, worship is reverent honor and homage paid to God. In the New Testament various words are used for worship. The word proskuneo "" to worship "" means to bow down to God or kings. Throughout most of Christianity's history, corporate Christian worship has been liturgical, characterized by prayers and hymns, with texts rooted in, or closely related to, the Scripture, particularly the Psalter ; this form of sacramental and ceremonial worship is still practiced by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican churches, as well as some Protestant denominations such as Lutheranism and Methodism. In Evangelicalism, worship is viewed like an act of adoration of God, with a more informal conception. The term liturgy is derived from the Greek leitourgia meaning "" public service "" and is formed by two words : "" laos "" (people) and "" ergon "" (work), literally "" work of the people "". Responsorial prayers are a series of petitions read or sung by a leader with responses made by the congregation. Set times for prayer during the day were established (based substantially on Jewish models), and a festal cycle throughout the Church year governed the celebration of feasts and holy days pertaining to the events in the life of Jesus, the lives of the saints, and aspects of the Godhead. A great deal of emphasis was placed on the forms of worship, as they were seen in terms of the Latin phrase lex orandi, lex credendi ("" the rule of prayer is the rule of belief"")that is, the specifics of one's worship express, teach, and govern the doctrinal beliefs of the community. According to this view, alterations in the patterns and content of worship would necessarily reflect a change in the faith itself. Each time a heresy arose in the Church, it was typically accompanied by a shift in worship for the heretical group. Orthodoxy in faith also meant orthodoxy in worship, and vice versa. Thus, unity in Christian worship was understood to be a fulfillment of Jesus ' words that the time was at hand when true worshipers would worship "" in spirit and in truth "" (John 4:23).

52,Johan Gottlieb Gahn,"Johan Gottlieb Gahn (19 August 1745  8 December 1818) was a Swedish chemist and metallurgist who discovered manganese in 1774. Gahn studied in Uppsala 1762  1770 and became acquainted with chemists Torbern Bergman and Carl Wilhelm Scheele. 1770 he settled in Falun, where he introduced improvements in copper smelting, and participated in building up several factories, including those for vitriol, sulfur and red paint. He was the chemist for The Swedish Board of Mines Bergskollegium from 1773  1817. Gahn was however very reluctant to publish his scientific findings himself, but freely communicated them to Bergman and Scheele. One of Gahn's discoveries was that manganese dioxide could be reduced to manganese metal using carbon, becoming the first to isolate this element in its metal form. In 1784, Gahn was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He also made a managerial career in Swedish mining. ","Falun | country | Swedish

63,"Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes","The Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI) is an organisation created by the British government in 1921 to run recreational establishments needed by the British Armed Forces, and to sell goods to servicemen and their families. It runs clubs, bars, shops, supermarkets, launderettes, restaurants, cafs and other facilities on most British military bases and also canteens on board Royal Navy ships. Commissioned officers are not usually supposed to use the NAAFI clubs and bars, since their messes provide these facilities and their entry, except on official business, is considered to be an intrusion into junior ranks ' private lives. NAAFI personnel serving aboard ship are part of the Naval Canteen Service (NCS), wear naval uniform and have action stations, but remain ordinary civilians. NAAFI personnel can also join the Expeditionary Force Institutes (EFI), which provides NAAFI facilities in war zones. EFI personnel are members of the Territorial Army serving on special engagements, bear ranks and wear uniform. NCS personnel can similarly volunteer to join the Royal Navy when it goes on active service. Petty Officer John Leake, NCS canteen manager in HMS Ardent, was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in the 1982 Falklands War for his courage while manning a machine gun.

65,Aspren,"Aspren or Asprenas () was a 1st-century Christian saint and venerated as the first Bishop of Naples. Aspren lived at the end of the 1st century and in the early 2nd century, as confirmed by archaeological studies regarding the early Neapolitan Church as well as the fact that "" Aspren "" was a common name during the days of the Roman Republic and the early years of the Roman Empire and afterwards fell into disuse. The Marble Calendar of Naples (Calendario Marmoreo di Napoli) attests to Aspren's existence and the fact that he lived during the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian ; Aspren's episcopate is stated as lasting twenty-three years. Nothing is known of his life, but an ancient legend holds that Saint Peter, on his way to Rome, stopped at Naples and converted an old woman (identified as Candida the Elder) after he cured her of an illness. Numerous other converts to Christianity were made during this time in Naples, including Aspren, who was converted either by Peter or Candida herself and who had also been ill. The legend holds that Peter consecrated Aspren as bishop of Naples and asked him to construct the oratory of Santa Maria del Principio, which would form the basis for the basilica of Santa Restituta ; San Pietro ad Aram was also said to have been built during this time.

66,Jimmy Frise,"The Canadian cartoonist James Llewellyn "" Jimmy "" Frise (, 16 October 1891   13 June 1948) is best known for his work on the comic strip Birdseye and his illustrations of humorous prose pieces by Greg Clark. Born in Scugog Island, Ontario, Frise moved to Toronto at 19 and found illustration work on the Toronto Stars Star Weekly supplement. His left hand was severely injured at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 during World War  I, but his drawing hand was unhurt, and he continued cartooning at the Star upon his return. In 1919 he began his first weekly comic strip, Life's Little Comedies, which evolved into the rural-centred humorous Birdseye in 1923. He moved to the Montreal Standard in 1947, but as the Star kept publication rights to Birdseye Center, Frise continued it as Juniper Junction with strongly similar characters and situations. Doug Wright took over the strip after Frise's sudden death from a heart attack in 1948, and it went on to become the longest-running strip in English-Canadian comics history.

It lies approximately north-east of Wielbark, south of Szczytno, and south-east of the regional capital Olsztyn. Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (East Prussia). In the East Prussian plebiscite of 1920, which was largely boycotted by ethnic Poles, the inhabitants voted to remain in Germany. After World War II the region was placed under Polish administration by the Potsdam Agreement under territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union. Most Germans fled or were expelled and replaced with Poles expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union or Ukrainians forced to settle in the area through Operation Vistula in 1947.

71,Vase de Noces,"Vase de Noces (also known as Wedding Trough and The Pig Fucking Movie) a 1974 Belgian avant-garde art exploitation film directed by Thierry Zno and starring Dominique Garny. The film deals openly, and sometimes graphically, with zoophilia. It features both real and simulated animal killings and coprophagia, and has been labeled obscene by many sources, notably by the OFLC of Australia. The film was banned in Australia by the Australian Classification Board in the mid 1970s with two failed attempts, according to the Australian Classification Board. The film went before the Australian Classification Board on April 1, 1977, and was banned again for the third time. The ban status on the film in Australia has remained largely unchanged since then, due to in part that the film violates Australian obscenity laws. ","OFLC | country | Australia

82,Breakout (video game),"Breakout is an arcade game developed and published by Atari, Inc., released on May 13, 1976. It was conceptualized by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow, influenced by the 1972 Atari arcade game Pong, and built by Steve Wozniak aided by Steve Jobs. Breakout was the basis and inspiration for certain aspects of the Apple II personal computer. The game was ported to the Atari 2600 and was followed by a 1978 sequel, Super Breakout, which four years later became the pack-in game for the Atari 5200 console. Breakout spawned an entire genre of Breakout clones, and the concept found new legs with Taito's 1986 Arkanoid which itself found dozens of imitators. In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play. ","Super Breakout | publication date | 1978

83,Winnebago War,"The Winnebago War, also known as the Winnebago Uprising, was a brief conflict that took place in 1827 in the Upper Mississippi River region of the United States, primarily in what is now the state of Wisconsin. Not quite a war, the hostilities were limited to a few attacks on American civilians by a portion of the Winnebago (or Ho-Chunk) Native American tribe. The Ho-Chunks were reacting to a wave of lead miners trespassing on their lands, and to false rumors that the United States had sent two Ho-Chunk prisoners to a rival tribe for execution. Most Native Americans in the region decided against joining the uprising, and so the conflict ended after U.S. officials responded with a show of military force. Ho-Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men who had participated in the violence, including Red Bird, who American officials believed to be the ringleader. Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial ; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President John Quincy Adams and released. As a result of the war, the Ho-Chunk tribe was compelled to cede the lead mining region to the United States. The Americans also increased their military presence on the frontier, building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts. The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together, and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward, a policy known as Indian removal. The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832, which involved many of the same people and concerned similar issues. ","Upper Mississippi River | country | the United States

84,Schizoanalysis,"Schizoanalysis (; schizo- from Greek  skhizein, meaning "" to split "") is a concept created by philosopher Gilles Deleuze and psychoanalyst Flix Guattari and first expounded in their book Anti-Oedipus (1972). Its formulation was continued in their follow-up work, A Thousand Plateaus. Schizoanalysis acquires many different definitions during the course of its development in their collaborative work and individually in the work of Guattari. In Chaosmosis, Guattari explains that "" rather than moving in the direction of reductionist modifications which simplify the complex "", schizoanalysis "" will work towards its complexification, its processual enrichment, towards the consistency of its virtual lines of bifurcation and differentiation, in short towards its ontological heterogeneity "".

"" This Little Girl of Mine "" played off "" This Little Light of Mine "", much like the previous "" I Got a Woman "" and the later "" Hallelujah I Love Her So "" played off other classic gospel hymns. And much like those songs, replaced sacred lyrics with secular blues lyrics with doo-wop call and response harmonies. The song was the B-side to Charles ' number-one R&B ; single, "" A Fool for You "", and was a charted hit on its own, peaking at number nine on the chart.

It is located in Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park about east of Mount Blackburn, the second highest volcano in the United States, and southeast of the massive Nabesna Glacier. Regal Mountain is the third highest thirteener (a peak between 13,000 and 13,999 feet in elevation) in Alaska, ranking just behind its neighbor, Atna Peaks. Because the mountain is almost entirely covered in glaciers, no geological studies have been done, but published references state and the geological map shows that the mountain is an old eroded volcanic edifice. Several major glaciers flow from the steep and heavily eroded flanks of Regal Mountain. The Rohn Glacier and Regal Glacier head east and southeast to join the Nizina Glacier, while the Root Glacier flows south to join the Kennicott Glacier just above the town of McCarthy. Each of those large glaciers exceeds in width, but largest of all on Regal Mountain is a massive unnamed glacier, over across, which flows northwest just over to join the mighty Nabesna.

93,Il regalo più grande,""" Il Regalo Pi Grande "" (English : "" The Greatest Gift "") is a song by Italian singer Tiziano Ferro. The song was written by Ferro for his fourth studio album, Alla Mia Et. The track was released as the album's second single on January 9, 2009. Three different versions of the song were also recorded in Spanish under the title "" El Regalo Ms Grande "". The first is a solo version by Ferro. The second version features Anah and Dulce Mara of the Mexican pop group RBD. These two versions were included on the Latin American edition of A Mi Edad, the Spanish-language version of Alla Mia Et. This second version served as the second Spanish single from A Mi Edad. Although the single credited Anah and Dulce Mara as solo acts, the Latin American edition of A Mi Edad credited RBD as the guest act in the CD itself. Lastly, a third Spanish version featuring former La Oreja de Van Gogh member, Amaia Montero, was also recorded. This version was included in the edition of A Mi Edad released for Spain, and served as the official Spanish-language version of the single promoted in the country.

94,East Asia Economic Caucus,"The East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) or East Asia Economic Group (EAEG) was a regional free trade zone (FTA) proposed in 1997 by Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad and encompasses the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Japan though refused participation due to the exclusion of the Western nations, which were already members of APEC and many other notable regional organizations in East Asia. The EAEC was a reaction to ASEAN's integration into the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) by Dr. Mahathir, who is known for his strong Asian standpoint. His suggestion apparently articulated his dissatisfaction with ASEAN joining APEC, which includes Western nations, an idea he was strongly opposed to. Therefore, EAEC was basically an APEC without North America and Australia. Nevertheless, it was never put into action officially. Recently the ASEAN+3 rounds might be called the successor of EAEC, which prompted Malaysia to state that EAEC was a reality. In 2005, due to Japan's support of the agreement, ASEAN Plus Three(ASEAN+3 or APT)agreed to include Australia, New Zealand, and India during the East Asia Summit.

95,Tiana (Disney),"Tiana is a main character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures ' 49th animated feature film The Princess and the Frog (2009). Created by directors Ron Clements and John Musker and animated by Mark Henn, Tiana is voiced by Anika Noni Rose as an adult, while Elizabeth M. Dampier voices the character as a child. Tiana is loosely based on two princesses : Princess Emma, the heroine of E. D. Baker's novel The Frog Princess, and the princess from the Brothers Grimm fairy tale "" The Frog Prince "", which inspired Baker's novel. A hardworking waitress who dreams of opening her own restaurant, Tiana finds her progress stalled when she transforms into a frog after desperately kissing a prince who has been turned into one by an evil witch doctor. The ninth Disney Princess, Tiana is the first to be of African-American heritage. Tiana has been mostly positively received, with critics praising her personality and values. However, the depiction of Tiana and her community has been criticized for lacking "" emphasis on racial issues "". The decision to depict the two main characters, Tiana and Naveen, as frogs for the majority of the movie has also caused controversy, with some saying that it is equating people of color to animals.

96,Vesper sparrow,"The vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) is a medium-sized American sparrow. It is the only member of the genus Pooecetes. Adults have light brown upperparts and light underparts, both with darker streaking. They have a white eye ring and a long dark brown tail which shows white outer feathers in flight. Their breeding habitat is open grassy areas across most of North America. The nest is an open cup on the ground under a clump of grass. These birds migrate to the southern and central United States and Mexico. These birds forage on the ground, mainly eating insects and seeds. Outside the nesting season they often feed in small flocks. The male sings from a higher perch, such as a shrub or fencepost, which indicates his ownership of the nesting territory. The musical song begins with two pairs of repeated whistled notes and ends in a series of trills, somewhat similar to that of the song sparrow. This bird's numbers are declining in the eastern parts of its range due to habitat loss. ","North America | has part | Mexico

97,Silvan Elves,"Silvan (wood elves) are a type of Elves in J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional universe of Middle-earth, mainly the Elves of Mirkwood and Lothlrien. They are commonly known as Wood-elves. In the First Age the Elves of Ossiriand, or Laiquendi, were also referred to as wood-elves. Silvan Elves are mainly Nandor in descent but also mixed with Avari. Many of them were later ruled over by a small population of social elites who were Sindar (Grey Elves) or even Noldor (High Elves). For example, Thranduil king of northern Mirkwood, as well as his son Legolas, were Sindarin Elves who ruled over a primarily Silvan population. Similarly Amdr and his son Amroth, the last Sindarin prince of Lorien, were Sindar. After Amroth was lost at sea, Galadriel and Celeborn came to rule over Lrien. Galadriel was a High Elf who belonged to the House of Finarfin, though she was actually of mixed Vanyar / Noldor / Telerin parentage, while Celeborn was also Sindarin (Sindar being a subset of the Teleri). Silvan Elves are described as being less wise than other Eldar, and some of them are almost indistinguishable from the Avari, those who never joined the Great Journey.

98,ABBA Live,"ABBA Live is an album of live recordings by Swedish pop group ABBA, released by Polar Music in 1986. A live album was something that many ABBA fans had demanded for several years. ABBA themselves had toyed with the idea on a couple of occasions, but always decided against it. Finally, four years after the members went their separate ways, a live collection was released after all. The resultant album, ABBA Live, contained recordings from 1977, 1979 and 1981. The tracks were mostly taken from ABBA s concerts at Wembley Arena in London in November 1979, with a few additional songs taken from the tour of Australia in March 1977 and the Dick Cavett Meets ABBA television special, taped in April 1981. When this LP / CD was released, the band's popularity was at an all-time low and none of the members themselves were involved in the production of the album. Much to the dismay of both music critics and ABBA fans it also had 80's synth drums overdubbed on most tracks, taking away the true live feeling of the performances. Neither did it feature any of the tracks that the band had performed live on their tours but never included on any of their studio albums, such as "" I Am an A "", "" Get on the Carousel "", "" I 'm Still Alive "", or the original live versions of the songs from the 1977 mini-musical The Girl with the Golden Hair : "" Thank You for the Music "", "" I Wonder (Departure) "" and "" I 'm a Marionette "", all of which had slightly different lyrics and/or musical arrangements to the subsequent studio recordings included on. Several tracks had also been heavily edited, in the case of the 1979 live recording of "" Does Your Mother Know "" by as much as five minutes since it originally was performed on that tour as a medley with "" Hole in Your Soul "". ABBA Live was the first ABBA album to be simultaneously released on LP and CD, the CD having three "" extra tracks "". The album did not perform very well, internationally or domestically, peaking at # 49 in Sweden and only staying in the charts for two weeks. It was remastered and rereleased by Polydor / Polar in 1997, but is currently out of print. ","Polar Music | country | Sweden

99,Young Wild Things Tour,"The Young Wild Things Tour was a four-band fall 2007 arena concert tour by Fall Out Boy with supporting acts Gym Class Heroes, Plain White T's, Cute Is What We Aim For, and Doug (from November 9 on). This is Fall Out Boy's biggest tour to date, grossing over $ 30 million. The tour sold out in five hours, with over 1.5 million tickets sold. The tour was first announced on the Fall Out Boy website, but instead of the traditional method of announcing tour dates in the same release as the announcement of the tour itself, the bands chose an unusual method. Fans would text a certain number and would be given a code for their state / area. That code would then be entered on a website. After an unknown amount of codes were entered, the tour date would be unlocked. The 31-date tour was only held in America, except for two Canadian dates. The tour began on October 18 and ran through December 2. Inspired by Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book Where the Wild Things Are, the concert tour included sets designed by artist Rob Dobi, containing images from the book. Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz explained, "" Where the Wild Things Are is a great narrative. It encapsulates pretty much every FOB song ever written : You know, tantrums and monster islands and all. "" "" There's also a play on words of the young wild thing idea that everybody has with Hollywood and starlets right now. "" ","Where the Wild Things Are | author | Maurice Sendak

100,Samuel C. Brightman,"Samuel C. Brightman (1911  1992) was a journalist, war correspondent, freelance writer and adult educator. Brightman started his career with the Louisville (KY) Courier-Journal covering education and politics and eventually becoming their Washington correspondent. In 1939 he spent seven months travelling a Europe on the verge of war, writing a series of articles for the Courier-Journal (his last installment was written from Poland shortly before Hitler invaded). He enlisted in the army in World War II and was assigned as a Public Relations Officer, responsible for transport, billeting, and general assistance for a group of newspaper reporters. He and his collection of reporters landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day with the American forces ; Brightman's were the first reports to reach the U.S. after the landing, despite the fact that their equipment landed nearly a mile away and there was no reliable route for their stories. Brightman received a Bronze Star for his efforts. After the war he took a position with the Democratic National Committee, an organization he remained with for nearly twenty years in various capacities including Deputy Director of Publicity, Director of Publicity, and managing editor of their monthly publication, The Democratic Digest, later called The Democrat. He was involved in several Democratic National Conventions in the 1950s and 1960s, generating publicity, press releases, and informational brochures for the party. Throughout his career he wrote extensively  columns, newsletters, essays, and speeches  on health care, the perils of aging, politics and political humor and, in his later years, on the importance of education in a democratic society and on ways to encourage civic literacy in the general population. He was the founding editor of "" Adult and Continuing Education Today "" and the first journalist to become devoted fully to covering adult education. ","Samuel C.

Draining a basin of, the river begins at the southern end of Klamath Lake and flows a short distance to the Link River Dam and continues to the head of Lake Ewauna. The "" falls "" from which Klamath Falls derives its name, and which in reality are best described as rapids rather than falls, are visible a short distance below the dam, though the water flow is generally insufficient to provide water flow over the rocks. The Klamath River begins at the narrow southern end of Lake Ewauna and flows from there to the Pacific Ocean. Before settlers came to the Klamath Basin, the Link River was known to the local Klamaths as Yulalona, meaning "" back and forth. "" At times, strong winds blew the water upstream into Klamath Lake and partly drained the riverbed. After its founding in 1867, Klamath Falls was originally named Linkville. The name was changed to Klamath Falls in 1892  93. ","Link River | country | U.S.

108,Paul Morphy,"Paul Charles Morphy (June 22, 1837   July 10, 1884) was an American chess player. He is considered to have been the greatest chess master of his era and an unofficial World Chess Champion. A chess prodigy, he was called "" The Pride and Sorrow of Chess "" because he had a brilliant chess career but retired from the game while still young. Bobby Fischer ranked him among the ten greatest players of all time, and described him as "" perhaps the most accurate player who ever lived "". Morphy was born in New Orleans to a wealthy and distinguished family. He learned to play chess by simply watching games between his father and uncle. His family soon recognized the boy's talent and encouraged him to play at family gatherings, and by the age of nine he was considered to be one of the best players in the city. At just twelve years of age, Morphy defeated visiting Hungarian master Johann Lwenthal in a match of three games. After receiving his degree in 1857, Morphy was not yet of legal age to practice law and found himself with free time. At his uncle's urging, he accepted an invitation to play at the First American Chess Congress in New York City. After winning the tournament, which included strong players such as Alexander Meek and Louis Paulsen, Morphy was hailed as the chess champion of the United States and stayed in New York playing chess through 1857, winning the vast majority of his games. In 1858, Morphy traveled to Europe to play European Champion Howard Staunton. Morphy played almost every strong player in Europe, usually winning easily. The match with Staunton never materialized, but Morphy was acclaimed by most in Europe as the world's best player. Returning to the United States in triumph, Morphy toured the major cities playing chess on his way back to New Orleans. By 1859, on returning to New Orleans, Morphy declared he was retiring from chess to begin his law career. However, Morphy was never able to establish a successful law practice and ultimately lived a life of idleness, living off his family's fortune. Despite appeals from his chess admirers, Morphy never returned to the game, and died in 1884 from a stroke at the age of 47. ","Paul Charles Morphy | date of birth | June 22, 1837

109,Gloria Estefan albums discography,"The album discography of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan consists of twenty studio albums, nine compilations, and seven EPs (combining Estefan's releases with her band, the Miami Sound Machine, and her solo releases). With estimated sales of 100 million of albums worldwide, she and Selena Quintanilla are the most successful female Latin crossover artists ever. Although they had been recording since the mid-1970s, Estefan's breakthrough came when Miami Sound Machine released the single "" Dr. Beat "" in Europe in 1984. Though a major hit there, the band did n't make a commercial impact in the United States until the following year with the release of the single, "" Conga "", which became a signature-song for Estefan. Both of the corresponding albums (Eyes of Innocence and Primitive Love) were credited to Miami Sound Machine. Their next album, 1987's Let It Loose (titled as Anything For You in Europe) was credited to Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine. All further albums after 1989's Cuts Both Ways onwards were credited solely to Estefan herself, though Miami Sound Machine continues to be her backing band and perform with her live to the present day. Estefan has also recorded many albums in Spanish, and her 1993 album, Mi Tierra, is one of the most successful Spanish-language albums released in the USA. The album was also an international hit and became the first album in Spain to gain a Diamond certification (for sales in excess of 1 million copies).

110,Tōkai region,"The is a subregion of the Chbu region and Kansai region in Japan that runs along the Pacific Ocean. The name comes from the Tkaid, one of the Edo Five Routes. Because Tkai is a sub-region and is not officially classified, there is some disagreement about where exactly the region begins and ends, however Japanese maps widely conclude that the region includes Shizuoka, Aichi, Gifu and Mie prefectures. The largest major city in the region is Nagoya and the Chky Metropolitan Area (Nagoya Metropolitan Area) makes up a large portion of the region and has Japan's third strongest economy. The business influence of this urban area sometimes extends out into the outlying areas of the three prefectures centered on Nagoya which are Aichi, Gifu, and Mie ; this area is sometimes referred to as the Chky region. Tkai is a heavy manufacturing area and is one of the most industrial regions in Japan. Its coast is lined with densely populated cities with economies that thrive on factories. The Tkai region has experienced a number of large earthquakes in the past, including the two great earthquakes in 1944 (also known as the "" Tonankai earthquake "") and 1945 (also known as the "" Mikawa earthquake ""). Following the work of Kiyoo Mogi, it is predicted that there is a possibility that the area will be subject to a shallow magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the near future. Nagoya, Shizuoka, and other large cities would be greatly damaged, with potential casualties in the tens of thousands. The Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction designated the region as an Area of Specific Observation in 1970, and upgraded it to an Area of Intensified Observation in 1974.

112,Loopline Bridge,"The Loopline Bridge (or the Liffey Viaduct) is a railway bridge spanning the River Liffey and several streets in Dublin, Ireland. It joins rail services from south of Dublin to Connolly Station and lines north. Designed by John Chaloner Smith (engineer to the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway), the bridge was built between 1889 and 1891. It consists of wrought iron lattice girders on a double row of piers with five spans. The viaduct is approximately six metres above street level and supports two railway tracks. During original planning and construction (in the late 19th century) the project was subject to much opposition and controversy, because the structure blocks the view down river to The Custom House. However, the bridge was deemed necessary as a rail link between north and south Dublin, and to facilitate the movement of transatlantic mail coming from Kingstown (Dn Laoghaire) and Queenstown (Cobh). 100 years later, the visage of the bridge remains the subject of some debate. Already arguably less attractive than some of Dublin's other bridges, the faades of the Loopline have been used by Iarnrd ireann for billboard advertising. , the company has scaled back the bridge's use for this purpose to reduce impact on the city skyline, following input from An Bord Pleanla and Dublin City Council. A prominent feature in the city landscape since 1891, the Loopline Bridge appears in one of the most famous literary works associated with Dublin : ","River Liffey | country | Ireland

116,German torpedo boat Kondor,"Kondor was the fifth of six Type 23 torpedo boats built for the German Navy (initially called the Reichsmarine and then renamed as the Kriegsmarine in 1935). The boat made multiple non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. During World War II, she played a minor role in the attack on Oslo, the capital of Norway, during the Norwegian Campaign of 1940. Kondor spent the next several months escorting minelayers as they laid minefields and damaged heavy ships back to Germany before she was transferred to France around September. She started laying minefields herself that month and continued to do so for the rest of the war. The boat returned to France in 1942 and helped to escort blockade runners, commerce raiders and submarines through the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay. Damaged by a mine shortly before the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944, Kondor was under repair on the day of the landings. Recognizing that she could not be repaired quickly, the boat was decommissioned later that month and was then further damaged by British bombers so that she was declared a constructive total loss.

118,Le Ventre de Paris,"Le Ventre de Paris (1873) is the third novel in mile Zola's twenty-volume series Les Rougon-Macquart. It is set in and around Les Halles, the enormous, busy central market of 19th-century Paris. Les Halles, rebuilt in cast iron and glass during the Second Empire was a landmark of modernity in the city, the wholesale and retail center of a thriving food industry. Le Ventre de Paris (translated into English under many variant titles but literally meaning The Belly of Paris) is Zola's first novel entirely on the working class. The protagonist is Florent, an escaped political prisoner mistakenly arrested after the French coup of 1851. He returns to his step-brother Quenu, a charcutier and his wife Lisa Quenu (formerly Macquart), with whom he finds refuge. They get him a job in the market as a fish inspector. After getting mixed up in an ineffectual socialist plot against the Empire, Florent is arrested and deported again. Although Zola had yet to hone his mastery of working-class speech and idioms displayed to such good effect in L'Assommoir, the novel conveys a powerful atmosphere of life in the great market halls and of working class suffering. There are a number of vivid descriptive passages, the most famous of which, his description of the olfactory sensations experienced upon entering a cheese shop, has become known as the "" Cheese Symphony "" due to its ingenious orchestral metaphors. Throughout the book, the painter Claude Lantier, a relative of the Macquarts and later the protagonist of L'uvre (1886)-shows up to provide a semi-authorial commentary, playing the role of chorus. It is an interesting and often powerful work, though not usually considered as being on a par with the novelist's achievements later in the Rougon-Macquart cycle.

120,Ne crois pas,""" Ne crois pas "" (, Do n't believe) is a song that was performed in the Eurovision Song Contest 1956 by French singer Michle Arnaud. It was the first of two Luxembourgish entry in the contest and was performed in French. In contrast to most of the other entries of this Contest, the song is an up-tempo number, with Arnaud telling a friend or lover that the fact that he looks good at the moment is largely meaningless. She tells him that his looks are due to his youth and that, as for the rest of humanity, he will lose his hair, gain weight and possibly lose his teeth as well. Thus, she tells him that he should "" take advantage of it "", rather than simply enjoying his looks at the time. The song was performed sixth on the night (following France's Math Altry with "" Le temps perdu "" and preceding Italy's Franca Raimondi with "" Aprite le finestre ""). As the scoreboard of this Contest has never been released, definitive statements about scores and positions are impossible to make, however the song did not win. The song was accompanied at the 1956 contest by Arnaud with "" Les amants de minuit "" and was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1957 contest by Danile Dupr with "" Amours mortes (tant de peine) "".

123,Upper Ammonoosuc River,"The Upper Ammonoosuc River is a tributary of the Connecticut River that flows through Cos County in northern part of the northeastern U.S. state of New Hampshire. Despite its name, the river is not an upstream portion of the Ammonoosuc River, but instead a separate tributary of the Connecticut River flowing from to the north of the Ammonoosuc. The Upper Ammonoosuc rises in Pond of Safety in the town of Randolph, runs first generally north through rural portions of Berlin (where it flows through the Godfrey Dam), Milan and a corner of Dummer, then west through Stark and then Northumberland where it drains into the Connecticut near the village of Groveton. The end points of that course are approximately 25 air miles (38 km) apart. From Milan to Groveton it is fairly closely paralleled by New Hampshire Route 110. Fort Wentworth was built in 1755 at the junction of the Upper Ammonoosuc and the Connecticut Rivers (now near the village of Groveton). The fort was used sporadically during both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. The watershed area includes the northern Crescent Range, eastern Pliny Range and the eastern and northern Pilot Range, all in the White Mountains. Major tributaries of the Upper Ammonoosuc include : ","Connecticut River | located in the administrative territorial entity | U.S.

128,Kurt Tucholsky,"Kurt Tucholsky (; 9 January 1890  21 December 1935) was a German-Jewish journalist, satirist, and writer. He also wrote under the pseudonyms Kaspar Hauser (after the historical figure), Peter Panter, Theobald Tiger and Ignaz Wrobel. Born in Berlin-Moabit, he moved to Paris in 1924 and then to Sweden in 1929. Tucholsky was one of the most important journalists of the Weimar Republic. As a politically engaged journalist and temporary co-editor of the weekly magazine Die Weltbhne he proved himself to be a social critic in the tradition of Heinrich Heine. He was simultaneously a satirist, an author of satirical political revues, a songwriter and a poet. He saw himself as a left-wing democrat and pacifist and warned against anti-democratic tendencies  above all in politics, the military and justice  and the threat of National Socialism. His fears were confirmed when the Nazis came to power in January 1933. In May of that year he was among the authors whose works were banned as "" un-German "", and burned ; he was also among the first authors and intellectuals whose German citizenship was revoked.

130,N. C. Wyeth,"Newell Convers Wyeth (October 22, 1882  October 19, 1945), known as N. C. Wyeth, was an American artist and illustrator. He was the pupil of artist Howard Pyle and became one of America's greatest illustrators. During his lifetime, Wyeth created over 3,000 paintings and illustrated 112 books, 25 of them for Scribner's, the Scribner Classics, which is the work for which he is best known. The first of these, Treasure Island, was one of his masterpieces and the proceeds paid for his studio. Wyeth was a realist painter just as the camera and photography began to compete with his craft. Sometimes seen as melodramatic, his illustrations were designed to be understood quickly. Wyeth, who was both a painter and an illustrator, understood the difference, and said in 1908, "" Painting and illustration can not be mixed  one can not merge from one into the other. "" He is the father of Andrew Wyeth and the grandfather of Jamie Wyeth, both known American painters. ","Andrew Wyeth | child | Jamie Wyeth

132,Bombtrack,""" Bombtrack "" is a song by American rap metal band Rage Against the Machine that opens their self-titled debut album. Like most of Rage Against the Machine's songs, the song's lyrics discuss social inequality, proclaiming that "" landlords and power whores "" were going to "" burn "". The riffs were composed by Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford. The song is one of three on the album in the key of F along with "" Know Your Enemy "" and "" Fistful of Steel "". Impressed by their song, Rage Against the Machine named it Bombtrack in reference to hip hop terminology where the word ' bomb ' means ' the greatest ', making the song title literally mean ' the greatest track '. A music video was released, depicting support for the Peruvian Maoist terrorist organization, Sendero Luminoso and its leader Abimael Guzman. The video clip did not appear on the group's first home video, citing Rage's first altered political opinion. In 2003, the video finally appeared as bonus material on their Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium DVD. The single artwork features Cuban photographer Alberto Korda's famous image of Che Guevara, Guerrillero Heroico. A mirrored version of the iconic two-tone portrait by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick (T-shirt version). Perhaps the song's most notable appearance outside of the music industry would be its appearance in Oliver Stone's controversial film Natural Born Killers, when Mickey breaks out of his prison cell in search of Mallory.

133,Christine Razanamahasoa,"Christine Harijaona Razanamahasoa is a Malagasy politician. She served as a Minister of Justice between 2009 and 2013, and as the president of the Malagasy National Assembly from February till May 2014, becoming the first woman in this position. Christine Razanamahasoa is a lawyer by education. On 17 March 2009, as a result of 2009 Malagasy political crisis, president Marc Ravalomanana was removed from his position, and the High Transitional Authority, led by Andry Rajoelina, was formed. The High transition authority elected Rajoelina the president of Madagascar, and Albert Camille Vital became the Prime Minister and formed the government. Christine Razanamahasoa became the Minister of Justice in that government. On 28 October 2011, Rajoelina dismissed the government and asked Omer Beriziky to form the new one. Razanamahasoa joined the new government, and on 31 October 2013 resigned and was replaced by Florent Rakotoarisoa. The reason for her resignation was that she intended to participate in forthcoming national elections. In 2013, she was elected to the National Assembly from Ambatofinandrahana District representing the MAPAR party, founded by the former president Andry Rajoelina. On 5 May 2014, the parliament elected the new president, and dismissed Razanamahasoa. The High Constitutional Court later confirmed that the voting was legal.

142,Ripton (fictional town),"Ripton is a fictitious town in Massachusetts, United States. Hugh Davis, brother of Hester A. Davis and a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, sought to demonstrate and protest the ignorance of the state bureaucracy in Boston of the rural portions of the commonwealth. To do so, he invented the town of Ripton. He then proceeded to apply for various grants and other official assistance, and the town was allotted funds in the state budget. Several checks were issued, and deposited in an escrow account, before the hoax was uncovered. The funds were returned and the matter dropped. In 1985, Representatives of the town of Ripton contacted the US Air Force and invited them to situate antennas for a post-nuclear war communication system in their town. Robbins Phillips, chairman of the Board of Selectmen of Ripton, stated that the antennas would make good nesting places for eagles. As a protest of the issue today, some signposts in the western portion of Massachusetts still contain "" directions "" to Ripton. Lawmakers in western Massachusetts continued to humorously reference the incident in proposed state budgets. ","Ripton | country | United States

152,Perpetual virginity of Mary,"The perpetual virginity of Mary is a Marian doctrine, taught by the Catholic Church and held by a number of groups in Christianity, which asserts that Mary (the mother of Jesus) was "" always a virgin, before, during and after the birth of Jesus Christ. "" This doctrine also proclaims that Mary had no marital relations after Jesus ' birth nor gave birth to any children other than Jesus. While the Bible mentions brothers of Jesus, Catholic, Orthodox, and some traditional Protestant interpretations offer various explanations that align with the doctrine of Mary's perpetual virginity ; that these siblings were either children of Joseph from a previous marriage, cousins of Jesus, or were closely associated with the Holy Family. By the fourth century, the doctrine was widely supported by the Church Fathers, and by the seventh century it had been affirmed in a number of ecumenical councils. The doctrine is part of the teaching of Catholicism and Anglo-Catholics, as well as Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy, as expressed in their liturgies, in which they repeatedly refer to Mary as "" ever virgin "" (). The Assyrian Church of the East, which is derived from the Church of the East, also accepts the perpetual virginity of Mary by titling her the "" Ever Virgin "", after the "" Second Heaven "". Some early Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther supported the doctrine, and founder figures of Anglicanism such as Hugh Latimer and Thomas Cranmer "" followed the tradition that they had inherited by accepting Mary as ' ever virgin ' "". Reformed teaching, however, largely abandoned it. The doctrine of perpetual virginity is currently maintained by some Anglican and Lutheran theologians. In addition, John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, affirmed the perpetual virginity of Mary. ","Mary | present in work | Bible

156,Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,"Extreme Makeover : Home Edition (EM : HE ; sometimes informally referred to as Extreme Home Makeover) is an American reality television series providing home improvements for less fortunate families and community schools. The show was hosted by former model, carpenter and veteran television personality Ty Pennington. Each episode features a family that has faced some sort of recent or ongoing hardship such as a natural disaster or a family member with a life-threatening illness, in need of new hope. The show's producers coordinate with a local construction contractor, which then coordinates with various companies in the building trades for a makeover of the family's home. This includes interior, exterior and landscaping, performed in seven days while the family is on vacation (paid for by the show's producers) and documented in the episode. If the house is beyond repair, they replace it entirely. The show's producers and crew film set and perform the makeover but do not pay for it. The materials and labor are donated. Many skilled and unskilled volunteers assist in the rapid construction of the house. EM : HE is considered a spin-off of Extreme Makeover, an earlier series providing personal makeovers (often including plastic surgery) to selected individuals. Unusual for a spin-off, Home Edition outlasted its mother show by several seasons. This show displays extreme changes to help recreate someone's space. However, the format differs considerably ; in the original Extreme Makeover, for instance, participants were not necessarily chosen based on any recent hardship, whereas the family's backstory is an important component of Home Edition. EM : HE also has similarities to other home renovation series such as Trading Spaces, on which Pennington was previously a key personality. The series was produced by Endemol USA (the people behind Big Brother, Fear Factor, Deal or No Deal, Wipeout, and other reality shows) in association with Disney-ABC Television Group's Greengrass Television. The Executive Producers were Brady Connell and George Verschoor. The program originally aired on Sunday evenings but was moved to Friday nights as of October 21, 2011. Upon the airing of its final episode in series form, and for the 2012 special holiday run, it remained ABC's last series to air solely in standard definition and never converted to a high definition or widescreen presentation. On December 15, 2011, ABC announced that Extreme Makeover : Home Edition would end its run on January 13, 2012. It will, however, continue to air as a special on the network.

158,"Tire, İzmir","Tire () is a populous district, as well as the center town of the same district, in zmir Province in western Turkey. By excluding zmir's metropolitan area, it is one of the prominent districts of the province in terms of population and is largely urbanized at the rate of 55.8 %. Tire's center is situated at a distance of to the south-east from the point of departure of the traditional center of zmir (Konak Square in Konkak) and lies at a distance of inland from the nearest seacoast in the Gulf of Kuadas to its west. Tire district area neighbors the district areas of Seluk (west) Torbal (north-west), Bayndr (north) and demi (east), all part of zmir Province, while to the south it is bordered by the districts of Aydn Province. The district area's physical features are determined by the alluvial plain of Kk Menderes River in its northern part and in its south by the mountains delimiting the parallel alluvial valley of Byk Menderes River flowing between Aydn and the Aegean Sea. There is a Jewish community. Advantaged by its fertile soil and suitable climate, Tire district's economy largely relies on production and processing of agricultural products, especially of figs, cotton, corn and other grains, cash crops like tobacco and sesame, fruits like watermelons, cherries, peaches and grenadines and dry fruits like walnuts and chestnuts. Tire center has an attractive old quarter with many impressive examples of Islamic architecture, and lively Tuesday and Friday markets, where the influence of the multicultural population of the surrounding villages can be observed. These two markets on two days of the week are famous across the larger region and among visitors on excursion and tourists for the handcrafted items found on sale and they attract a large customer base. A yearly event that also draws crowds to Tire is one of the liveliest and the most rooted (since 1403) celebrations in western Turkey of Nevruz Day on the third Sunday of every March. A famous local speciality is Tire kebab. ","İzmir Province | located in the administrative territorial entity | Turkey

As the type species of its genus Oecophora, its affiliations and phylogeny (which are not completely known however) determine the delimitation of that family and subfamily. It is native to Europe, where it inhabits woodland. The species is not often found in the outlying regions ; in the UK for example it has only been recorded from a few patches of old-growth forest in the English Midlands (e.g. Wyre Forest), southern England, and southern Wales (e.g. in the Wye valley). The adults ' wingspan is 1216  mm. Conspicuously bicolored black and yellow, they also have some iridescent blue markings on the forewings. The adult moths fly from May to July depending on the location ; they are semi-diurnal and can be encountered during the day, but usually are active at dawn. The caterpillars feed on dead and decaying wood, and possibly also on fungi. ","UK | continent | Europe

"" Becoming independent on the dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991, these countries shortly requested the advice and assistance of the United States in creating new self-defense forces. They had been acquired by the Soviet Union from the European Theatre of World War II. The requests began among the Baltic states, notably Latvia, which had approached NATO. It sent a delegation from five member countries, including the U.S., which chose the National Guard Bureau as most appropriate spokesman, considering that Latvia could not afford a standing army. EUCOM thus became the first of the six geographic Combatant Commands that make up the "" global SPP, "" and the NG, which is divided into state-sized contingents, became the host of each state-sized new national force, typically, but not necessarily, one-to-one, totally voluntarily.

Sabet was a long time aide to former Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. After leaving Afghanistan, he worked in the U.S. for Voice of America. After living in Montreal, Sabet returned to Afghanistan to work for a human rights organization, before being appointed special adviser at the Interior Ministry. He was promoted to Attorney General in May 2006. Sources close to the President Hamid Karzai say that Sabet was promoted with U.S. support in exchange for giving positive comments about the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. He has however been critical of the Guantanamo release policy. A series of articles on former Guantanamo captives, published by the McClatchy News Service, quoted Sabet commenting that the release of Guantanamo captives seemed to be divorced from the captives ' role in the Taliban, and to be focussed largely on whether the captives complied with the camp rules. In April 2007, Sabet launched a violent raid on Tolo TV (the country's largest private TV chain) for what he thought was a "" distorted "" report on his comments regarding the country's judicial system. Seven journalists from the TV station were taken to his office by force without warrants and severely beaten. ","Abdul Jabar Sabet | country of citizenship | Afghan

174,Greatest Hits (A-Teens album),"Greatest Hits is A-Teens ' last album. It is a compilation including their biggest worldwide hits, such as "" Mamma Mia "", "" Upside Down "", "" Halfway Around the World "", "" Floorfiller "", and many others. Every track included on the album (except for the new tracks) reached the Top 20 in at least one country. The album was planned to be released in early 2004, but due to problems with Stockholm Records / Universal Music, A-Teens released the album on May 5, 2004. For the release of this album, the A-Teens called all their fans through their website asking for pictures, and they included the pictures on the booklet of the album. The tracks "" The Final Cut "" and "" With or Without You "" were written by the members of the band, giving messages of "" goodbye "" and "" thanks "" to their fans. This album was not released worldwide. Instead, it was released in selected territories where Universal thought it would do well. These included Mexico, Argentina, Germany, and some other European and Asian countries. The album went on to sell over 10,000 copies in Argentina and another 3,000 in Brazil ; overall, the album sold relatively well in Latin America and some parts of Europe, where "" I Promised Myself "" was a huge hit. An American edition was planned for this album, and it was going to be released through Interscope Records in late 2004. However, the A-Teens were already finishing their Greatest Hits Tour in Sweden and they did n't want to promote in America as Dhani was about to release his first solo single there, so Interscope cancelled the release.

176,Carol II of Romania,"Carol II (15 October 18934 April 1953) reigned as King of Romania from 8 June 1930 until his coerced abdication on 6 September 1940. Carol was the eldest son of Ferdinand I and became crown prince upon the death of his grand-uncle, King Carol I in 1914. He was the first of the Hohenzollern kings of Romania to be born in the country (both of his predecessors were born and grew up in Germany and only came to Romania as adults). Carol, by contrast, spoke Romanian as his first language and was the first member of the Romanian royal family to be raised in the Orthodox faith. He possessed a hedonistic personality that contributed to the controversies marring his reign, and his life was marked by numerous scandals, among them marriages to Zizi Lambrino and Princess Helen of Greece and Denmark, daughter of King Constantine I of Greece. His continued affairs with Magda Lupescu obliged him to renounce his succession rights in 1925 and leave the country. Princess Helen eventually divorced him in 1928. King Ferdinand died in 1927 and Carol's five-year-old son ascended the throne as Michael I. Carol then returned to Romania in 1930 and replaced his son and the regency that had been in place. His reign was marked by re-alignment with Nazi Germany, adoption of anti-semitic laws and ultimately evolved into a personal dictatorship beginning in 1938. On 6 September 1940, he was forced by his Prime Minister Ion Antonescu to leave the country and withdraw abroad into exile. He was succeeded by his son Michael.

177,Metropolitan statistical area,"In the United States, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area. Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be, nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states ; because of this, the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source. A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region (e.g.,  New York City or Philadelphia). However, some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position (e.g.,  Dallas  Fort Worth metroplex, Norfolk-Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), Riverside  San Bernardino (Inland Empire) or Minneapolis  Saint Paul (Twin Cities)). MSAs are defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and used by the Census Bureau and other federal government agencies for statistical purposes.

179,List of songs recorded by Rage Against the Machine,"Rage Against the Machine is an American rap metal band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1991, the group consists of vocalist Zack de la Rocha, guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk. After a self-issued demo, the band signed with Epic Records and released its self-titled debut album Rage Against the Machine in 1992, the material for which was written by all four members of the group. After contributing the single "" Year of tha Boomerang "" to the Higher Learning soundtrack in 1995, the band released its second studio album Evil Empire in 1996, on which "" Year of tha Boomerang "" was featured as the closing track. In 1997 the band released a cover version of Bruce Springsteen's "" The Ghost of Tom Joad "", and the following year contributed "" No Shelter "" to the soundtrack to the film Godzilla, as well as releasing it as a single. In 1999 the band released its final album of original material, The Battle of Los Angeles, which again credited all four members equally for songwriting. The group disbanded in October 2000, after de la Rocha departed to focus on producing his first solo album. After the group's breakup, Epic released Renegades in December 2000, which featured cover versions of songs originally recorded by several hip hop artists, rock bands and other artists.

181,Mike Padden,"Michael John "" Mike "" Padden (born November 13, 1946) is a lawyer and politician from Spokane Valley, Washington. He is a member of the Washington State Senate representing Washington's 4th Legislative District. Padden is well known as a "" faithless elector "", a Presidential Elector who casts his vote for someone other than for whom he has pledged to vote. In the 1976 U.S. presidential election, Gerald Ford, the Republican candidate and incumbent, had lost the race to Democrat, and former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter. Rather than vote as pledged, for President Ford, Padden instead cast his vote for Ronald Reagan, who had lost the Republican nomination to Ford earlier that year. He entered the Washington House of Representatives in January 1981 and served there until 1995 when he was appointed to serve as a district court judge in the Spokane County District Court. On June 13, 2006, Padden announced he would not run for re-election as judge. In 2007, evidence surfaced that Padden used his influence as a judge to help direct more than $ 7.5 million in fees and interest payments to a former employer. At Padden s request, the state Commission on Judicial Conduct has issued a statement confirming that it examined complaints about Padden s 1999 selection of a former client as the official collection agency for District Court but found nothing to support an ethics violation. The commission typically acknowledges complaints only if it imposes discipline or sanctions. The agency, however, refused to disclose how it arrived at its conclusion or what the initial examination entailed. Padden was elected to the Washington Senate in November 2011.

183,Zevs (artist),"Zevs (born Christophe Aguirre Schwarz on 17 November 1977 in Saverne, France) is a French street artist, best known for his trademark "" liquidation "" technique. He was an early and influential graffiti artist and active as a tagger in Paris in the 1990s. He is named after a regional train, Zeus, that almost ran him over one day he was down in the metro. Working with other French artists in the second half of the 1990s like Andr and Invader, Zevs has been among the prominent figures who pioneered the French street art scene. By the end of the 1990s he became known for his poetic drawings of shadows in Paris, shortly after the departure of Facundo Newbery from Paris. Later he ' bombed ' models on the billboards between the eyes. Though his interventions have been very popular, it has been discussed in France whether it is vandalism or art. In 2008 Zevs had his first major survey exhibition at the classical art museum the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen, Denmark. His work, including selections of all of his major series to that point, was displayed alongside masterpieces in the museum's permanent collections such as douard Manet's The Absinthe Drinker and Auguste Rodin's The Thinker.

It took part in the 29 July 2001 presidential elections, in which its candidate, Fradique de Menezes, won 55.2 % of the vote and was elected president. After the elections Fradique de Menezes joined a new party-the Force for Change Democratic Movement-Liberal Party.

In the July 2006 presidential election, its leader Patrice Trovoada ran as the only major opposition candidate, but he was defeated by Menezes. Trovoada became Prime Minister in February 2008, but was defeated in a May 2008 vote of confidence proposed by the Movement for the Liberation of So Tom and Prncipe / Social Democratic Party (MLSTP / PSD), and in June Menezes asked the MLSTP / PSD to form a new government. The ADI denounced Menezes ' designation of the MLSTP / PSD to form a government as unconstitutional, arguing that it was too late in the parliamentary term to do so, and it took the matter to the Supreme Tribunal of Justice.

187,Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System,"The Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System is a seasonal upwelling system in the eastern Great Australian Bight, extending from Ceduna, South Australia, to Portland, Victoria, over a distance of about. Upwelling events occur in the austral summer (from November to May) when seasonal winds blow from the southeast. These winds blow parallel to the shoreline at certain areas of the coast, which forces coastal waters offshore via Ekman transport and draws up cold, nutrient-rich waters from the ocean floor. Because the deep water carries abundant nutrients up from the ocean floor, the upwelling area differs from the rest of the Great Australian Bight, especially the areas offshore of Western Australia and the Nullabor in South Australia, which are generally nutrient-poor. Every summer, the upwelling sustains a bountiful ecosystem that attracts blue whales and supports rich fisheries. The Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System (GSACUS) is Australia's only deep-reaching coastal upwelling system, with nutrient-enriched water stemming from depths exceeding. Recently, a new upwelling centre has been discovered on the western shelf of Tasmania. Since this new upwelling centre is located outside South Australian waters, the entire upwelling system should be rather called the Great Southern Australian Coastal Upwelling System.

190,Chachalaca,"Chachalacas are galliform birds from the genus Ortalis. These birds are found in wooded habitats in far southern United States (Texas), Mexico, and Central and South America. They are social, can be very noisy and often remain fairly common even near humans, as their relatively small size makes them less desirable to hunters than their larger relatives. As invasive pests, they have a ravenous appetite for tomatoes, melons, beans, and radishes and can ravage a small garden in short order. They travel in packs of six to twelve. They somewhat resemble the guans, and the two have commonly been placed in a subfamily together, though the chachalacas are probably closer to the curassows. The generic name is derived from the Greek word , meaning "" pullet "" or "" domestic hen. "" The common name is an onomatopoeia for the four-noted cackle of the plain chachalaca (O. vetula). Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data tentatively suggest that the chachalacas emerged as a distinct lineage during the Oligocene, somewhere around 4020 mya, possibly being the first lineage of modern cracids to evolve ; this does agree with the known fossil record  including indeterminate, cracid-like birds  which very cautiously favors a north-to-south expansion of the family.

194,Riksakten,"The Riksakten was the 1815 Act of Union that regulated the terms of the constitutional personal union between Sweden and Norway established in 1814. The fundamental documents of the union were only the Convention of Moss and the revised Norwegian constitution of 4 November 1814. The Norwegian constitution had been adapted to the union before it was entered into, but the Swedish one was never adjusted correspondingly. The conservative Swedish Riksdag had not allowed the Swedish constitution of 1809 to be revised. Therefore, a bilateral treaty had to be negotiated in order to clarify procedures for treating constitutional questions that had to be decided jointly by both governments. The Act of Union (Riksakten) was negotiated during the spring of 1815, with prime minister Peder Anker leading the Norwegian delegation. The treaty contained twelve articles dealing with the king's authority, the relationship between the two legislatures, how the executive power was to be exercised if the king should die before the crown prince had attained majority, and the relationship between the cabinets. It also confirmed the practice of treating questions of foreign policy in the Swedish cabinet, with the Norwegian prime minister present. Vital questions pertaining to the Union were to be treated in a joint cabinet meeting, where all the Norwegian ministers in Stockholm would be present. The Act was passed by the Storting 31 July 1815 and by the Riksdag 6 August, and sanctioned by the king on 15 August. In Sweden the Act of Union was a set of provisions under regular law, but the Norwegian Storting gave it constitutional status, so that its provisions could only be revised according to the procedures laid down in the constitution. The Riksakten contained 12 paragraphs : ","Peder Anker | country of citizenship | Norway

A native of Livilivi, Province of Potos, Pacheco won a disputed election that was a virtual three-way tie between him, Conservative leader Aniceto Arce, and Liberal chief Eliodoro Camacho. Pacheco was self-made a wealthy man (he was born poor) and the country's foremost philanthropist. He made his money purchasing shares in defunct silver mines which he rehabilitated. By the mid 19th century Pacheco emerged as a wealthy, efficient, progressive, and pragmatic silver tycoon.

202,LEC billing,"LEC billing is a form of billing for Internet-based or other usually electronic services where the user is charged through his account with the local telephone company (also known as the local exchange carrier or LEC), rather than directly from the provider of the service. LEC billing is permitted in the United States as the breakup of the Bell System forced local telcos out of the long distance business ; each client would otherwise receive multiple monthly bills (one for local service, one for long distance). There is no LEC billing for alternate long distance carriers in Canada as Bell Canada and Telus remain in the long-distance business and do not collect on behalf of their competitors. The LEC billing system is subject to abuse by vendors. Cramming is a form of phone fraud in which a third-party vendor adds unauthorised charges to a subscriber's local telephone bill.

204,Lunula (amulet),"A lunula (plural : lunulae) was a crescent moon shaped pendant worn by girls in ancient Rome. Girls ideally wore them as an apotropaic amulet, the equivalent of the boy's bulla. In the popular belief the Romans wore amulets usually as a talisman, to protect themselves against evil forces, demons and sorcery, but especially against the evil eye. In Plautus ' play, Epidicus asks the young girl Telestis : "" Do n't you remember my bringing you a gold lunula on your birthday, and a little gold ring for your finger ?

Joining together with Nakano Seig, Akira Kazami, and others, Adachi formed the right-wing political organization Kokumin Dmei in December 1932 The Kokumin Dmei advocated a form of state socialism or corporatism with government control of strategic industries and financial institutions, and the creation of a Japan-Manchukuo economic union. The new party consisted mainly of defectors from the Minseit, and had an original strength of 32 seats in the Diet of Japan. In 1934, it demanded an inquiry into the Teijin Incident in an effort to bring down the cabinet of Prime Minister Sait Makoto. However, in 1935, many members returned to the Minseit fold, and in 1936, Nakano left the party to form the Thkai the following year, and Kazami joining Fumimaro Konoe s think tank, the Shwa Kenkykai. In the 1937 General Election, the party's strength fell from 32 seats to 11 seats. In June 1940, The Kokumin Dmei was merged into the Imperial Rule Assistance Association as part of Hideki Tj's efforts to create a one-party state, and thereafter ceased to exist.

Unlike many sites created by people of the same culture, it occupies an upland site near a major river floodplain. Its existence appears to have been the result of the coincidence of periods of peace and growth in the related Angel Site, which led some townspeople to leave their homes for new villages that were more convenient for resource gathering. Researched partly because of its small size, Ellerbusch has produced information that greatly increases present awareness of other small sites and of its culture's overall patterns of settlement in the region. Because of its archaeological value, the site was declared a historic site in the late twentieth century. ","U.S. | contains administrative territorial entity | Indiana

The book is significant as the first serious representation of the Rastafari movement in literature. Mais foresaw the defining power of the Rasta movement to Jamaican society 20 years before the era of Bob Marley and Reggae mainstream. It is also significant as an exploration of life in the ghetto of Kingston. It shows how the people relate to leaders, both making them deities and throwing them away when they fail to entertain them. The novel is written in prose with a layout that is seemingly cinematic and episodic ; little is done to describe the environment beyond the claustrophobic ghetto of ' The Lane ' in the slums of Kingston, Jamaica.

220,Tulelake camp,"The Tule Lake camp was a federal work facility and WRA isolation center located in Siskiyou County, five miles west of Tulelake, California. It was established by the United States government in 1935 during the Great Depression for vocational training and work relief for young men, in a program known as the Civilian Conservation Corps. The camp was established initially for CCC enrollees to work on the Klamath Reclamation Project. During World War II, in 1942 the Tule Lake War Relocation Center was built next to the camp as one of ten concentration camps in the interior of the US for the incarceration of Japanese Americans who had been forcibly relocated from the West Coast, which was defined as an Exclusion Zone by the US military. Two-thirds of the 120,000 incarcerated individuals were United States citizens. Renamed the Tule Lake Isolation Center, this facility was adapted in the wartime years to shelter Japanese-American strikebreakers used against resisters at the main segregation camp, imprison Japanese-American dissidents, and house Italian and German prisoners of war (POWs) who were assigned to work as farm laborers in the region. After the war, on 25 April 1946, the camp was transferred from the Army to the Fish and Wildlife Service, which had managed it just prior to the establishment of the segregation camp. The four remaining buildings are being restored in a project to return the camp to its 1940s appearance. ","WRA | country | United States

Unlike the majority of the adapted characters in the film, Louie was not featured in Rudyard Kipling's original works. King Louie was portrayed as an orangutan who was the leader of the other jungle primates, and who attempted to gain knowledge of fire from Mowgli, in order to become more human. King Louie was voiced by Louis Prima in the original 1967 film. Initially, the filmmakers considered Louis Armstrong for the role, but to avoid the likely controversy that would result from casting a black person to voice an ape, they instead chose Prima, a white singer. Christopher Walken voiced King Louie in the 2016 live-action / CGI The Jungle Book film. ","King Louie | performer | Louis Prima

224,John Henry Dearle,"John Henry Dearle or J. H. Dearle (1859 in London  15 January 1932) was a British textile and stained-glass designer trained by the artist and craftsman William Morris who was much influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Dearle designed many of the later wallpapers and textiles released by Morris & Co., and contributed background and foliage patterns to tapestry designs featuring figures by Edward Burne-Jones and others. Beginning in his teens as a shop assistant and then design apprentice, Dearle rose to become Morris & Co.'s chief designer by 1890, creating designs for tapestries, embroidery, wallpapers, woven and printed textiles, stained glass, and carpets. Following Morris's death in 1896, Dearle was appointed Art Director of the firm, and became its principal stained glass designer on the death of Burne-Jones in 1898. Morris's reputation overshadowed Dearle's work throughout Dearle's career : Dearle exhibited early patterns under Morris's name and Dearle designs continue to be sold as Morris patterns. Critical assessment of Dearle's work then underwent a significant change, during the final decades of the twentieth century, recognizing Dearle's mature work as having a unique artistic vision of its own. Dearle always remained close to Morris's esthetic, but from the 1890s onward he incorporated a distinctive set of Persian and Turkish influences. ","John Henry Dearle | date of birth | 1859

227,The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons,""" The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons "" is the seventh episode of The Simpsons ' ninth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 16, 1997. It was written by Richard Appel and directed by Steven Dean Moore. The episode sees Apu Nahasapeemapetilon marry Manjula, and incorporates several aspects of Hindu wedding ceremonies, which the writers researched during the episode's production. Appel pitched the episode several years before season nine but the idea was not used until Mike Scully became showrunner. The episode's subplot, which sees Homer stay at the Springfield Retirement Castle, was initially conceived as a separate episode, but could not be developed in enough detail. The episode received mixed reviews. ","Fox | country | the United States

It was animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten and the Nippon Television Network. Ocean Waves first aired on May 5, 1993 on Nippon TV. The film is set in the city of Kchi, on the Japanese island of Shikoku.

In December 2016, GKIDS announced that the film would be remastered for a limited theatrical release, beginning on December 28, 2016, with a home video release in Spring 2017.

230,Mavis Grind,"Mavis Grind (or, meaning "" gate of the narrow isthmus "") is a narrow isthmus joining the Northmavine peninsula to the rest of the island of Shetland Mainland in the Shetland Islands, UK. It is just wide at its narrowest point. It carries the main A970 road to Hillswick in the north west of Shetland and is about two miles west of the settlement of Brae. Mavis Grind is said to be the only place in the UK where you can toss a stone across land from the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. It is a regular crossing point for otters, which in Shetland are sea-dwelling. In 1999, local volunteers successfully helped to demonstrate whether Viking ships could be carried across the isthmus, instead of sailing around the end of the island. Remains of a late Bronze Age settlement have been found close by. ","Shetland Islands | country | UK

It comprises recordings from sessions for Blue Note and United Artists Records as a sideman for Paul Chambers, Sonny Clark, Johnny Griffin, and Cecil Taylor that were issued respectively on their Whims of Chambers, Sonny's Crib, A Blowin ' Session, and Hard Driving Jazz albums. Two selections are from Coltrane's own 1957 Blue Train, and "" One for Four "" had been previously unissued. "" Trane's Blues "" had been issued on the compilation High Step in 1975, previously known as "" John Paul Jones "" and named after himself, the bass player Chambers, and the drummer Philly Joe Jones. Like Prestige Records before them, as Coltrane's fame grew long after he had stopped recording for the label, Blue Note used varied recordings, often those where Coltrane had been merely a sideman, and reissued them as a new album with Coltrane's name prominently displayed. In this case, the Big Four conglomerate EMI continued that earlier practice. ","John Coltrane | record label | Blue Note Records

As Fingerprince was originally meant to be a three-sided album (a concept abandoned due to expense and Monty Python's Matching Tie and Handkerchief beating them to the punch), much of the material was abandoned and the third side remained unfinished until November 1977 although most tracks from the EP was shown at the Residents Radio Special in September 1977. Thus, the group reduced the third side to an extended play record entitled ' "" Babyfingers ' "", and released it in 1979 to people who had been waiting for their copy of The Third Reich and Roll box sets. A second printing was made for members of the W.E.I.R.D. fan club in 1981, and a last pressing, on pink vinyl, in 1985.

244,"Statue of Jan Smuts, Parliament Square","A life-size bronze statue of Jan Smuts by the British artist Jacob Epstein stands on the north side of Parliament Square in London, United Kingdom, between a statue of Lord Palmerston and a statue of David Lloyd George. Smuts served as an army general and as a member of the Imperial War Cabinet in the First World War, and then served as Prime Minister of South Africa twice, from 1919 to 1924 and from then 1939 to 1948. The statue depicts him in his military uniform as a field marshal, leaning forward with his left leg advanced, as if walking forward. The statue stands on a pedestal of granite from South Africa, which bears the inscription. After Winston Churchill won the 1951 UK general election in October 1951, he proposed erecting a statue in Parliament Square as a memorial to Smuts, who had died in September 1950. Churchill retired as prime minister in 1955, and was too ill to perform the unveiling in November 1956 ; it was unveiled instead by the Speaker of the House of Commons, William Morrison. The statue became a Grade II listed building in 1970. ","Parliament Square | country | United Kingdom

245,Panama during World War II,"The history of Panama during World War II begins in 1939. Due to the American-controlled Panama Canal cutting across the center of the country, Panama was of major strategic importance to the Allied war effort, as well as the most important strategic location in Latin America during World War II. It provided an invaluable link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans that was vital to both commerce and the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, the defense of the Canal Zone was the United States ' chief concern in the American Theater. Panama never received Lend-Lease assistance, but in return for the rights to build military infrastructure within Panamanian territory, the United States undertook large-scale public works projects, which did much to modernize the country and boost the economy.

246,Arthur Percival,"Lieutenant-General Arthur Ernest Percival, (26 December 1887  31 January 1966) was a senior British Army officer. He saw service in the First World War and built a successful military career during the interwar period but is most noted for his defeat in the Second World War, when he commanded British Commonwealth forces during the Japanese Malayan Campaign and the subsequent Battle of Singapore. Percival's surrender to the invading Imperial Japanese Army force, the largest surrender in British military history, undermined Britain's prestige as an imperial power in East Asia. His defenders, such as Sir John Smyth, have argued that under-funding of Malaya's defences and the inexperienced, under-equipped nature of the Commonwealth army, not Percival's leadership, were ultimately to blame.

Postwar British sourced Vauxhalls continued to keep the plant running together with limited numbers (restricted by currency shortages) of Chevrolets. In the late 1950s the Vauxhall and the now expansive Chevrolet and Pontiac cars began to be replaced with Australian sourced Holden vehicles supplemented by the smallest Vauxhalls and Holdens and the move to the Holden brand was completed in the 1970s. The assembly of vehicles ended in 1990 and since then the business has been distribution of complete imported vehicles and spare parts. ","General Motors New Zealand Limited | country | New Zealand

248,Piton des Neiges,"The Piton des Neiges (Snow Peak) is a massive 3,069  m (10,069  ft) shield volcano on Runion, one of the French volcanic islands in the Mascarene Archipelago in the southwestern Indian Ocean. It is located about east of Madagascar. Piton des Neiges is the highest point on Runion and is considered to be the highest point in the Indian Ocean. The volcano was formed by the Runion hotspot and emerged from the sea about two million years ago. Now deeply eroded, the volcano has been inactive for 20,000  years and is surrounded by three massive crater valleys, the Cirques. Piton des Neiges forms the northwestern two thirds of Runion, with the very active Piton de la Fournaise comprising the rest. As it name suggests, snow is occasionally seen on its summit in winter. The volcanic island is considered to be about three million years old (Pliocene) ; the other two islands in the archipelago, Mauritius and Rodrigues, are 7.8  million (Miocene) and 1 million (Pleistocene) years old, respectively. The island possesses a high endemism of flowering plants (about 225) ; this has justified the creation of a biological reserve on the lower slopes of the Piton des Neiges.

249,Irish experiment,"The Irish Experiment is the popular name for the interest, primarily from VFL / AFL clubs, in bringing Irish Gaelic footballers over to Australia to play Australian rules football professionally. The AFL's focus on Gaelic footballers is due to the similarities between the sports. The Irish Experiment began in the mid-1980s as an informal project of the Melbourne Football Club. Despite its initial success, enthusiasm for the project lapsed until the 2000s, when it again became ongoing and currently increasing due to globalisation and professionalism in sport. The highest profile product of the experiment to date has been Medal of the Order of Australia and Brownlow Medal recipient Jim Stynes, who was an early recruit. Irishman Tadhg Kennelly was a key player in the Sydney Swans 2005 AFL Grand Final victory. The highest profile Gaelic footballer to sign an AFL contract is Tommy Walsh. Over the years the Irish experiment has attracted media and public interest in both Ireland and Australia. ","Jim Stynes | country of citizenship | Australia

252,Argentine heavy metal,"The Argentine heavy metal is a heavy metal music movement that originated in Argentina in the 1980s. The first popular artist was Pappo, who created the band Riff influenced by the contemporary new wave of British heavy metal. V8 was formed at that time as well, and most of its members created notable bands after their respective departures from the band : Ricardo Iorio and Walter Giardino, currently in Almafuerte and Rata Blanca, are still popular. The second half of the 1980s saw the success of hard rock bands such as Kamikaze, Alakran and Rata Blanca, with an aesthetic similar to the contemporary glam metal. Thrash metal bands, such as Hermtica, Horcas and Lethal, appeared in the early 1990s. Rata Blanca declined its popularity in the 1990s and eventually broke up. Hermtica became more popular than V8 during its short existence, and broke up in a controversy between the leader Ricardo Iorio and the other members. Iorio created a new band, Almafuerte, and the former members of Hermtica stayed together for some time as Maln. Rata Blanca had a revival later, and the band was rejoined.

The site at Panlongcheng was sparsely inhabited during the Erlitou period, consisting mainly of several small settlements and occupying an area of around 200,000 m. During the early Erligang period, the site suddenly grew rapidly, reaching an area of around with a walled center of 75,000 m. Panlongcheng may have been an Erligang outpost used to control regional resources, such as copper mines. The construction and bronze casting techniques at Panlongcheng are identical with the techniques employed at Erligang and Zhengzhou ; however, the pottery style is different. The style of Erligang elite burials is almost an exact replica of the burials at Zhengzhou ; however, later layers show that the Erligang style disappeared during the later stages of the Erligang culture. The site declined until it was abandoned altogether at the end of the Erligang culture. Panlongcheng's decline may have been affected in part by the growth of the site at Wucheng. In Hubei Province, other sites such as Jingnansi and Baimiaozhu also feature Erlitou or Late Erlitou  Early Erligang type of ceramics.

He served on board Lexington (CV-2) and was rated aviation radioman third class before being transferred to Torpedo Squadron 8 on board Hornet (CV-8). He received the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism and extraordinary achievement as rear gunner in a torpedo plane during an attack against enemy Japanese forces in the Battle of Midway 4 June 1942. Flying without fighter support and with insufficient fuel to return to their carrier, Huntington and his fellow crewmember pressed home their attack with utter disregard for their own personal safety, in the face of a tremendous antiaircraft barrage and overwhelming fighter opposition. Huntington was one of 29 from Torpedo Squadron 8 who gave their lives in this attack. ","Robert Kingsbury Huntington | place of birth | Los Angeles

Guitarist Jimmy Page and singer Robert Plant began writing it in the summer of 1975 and were influenced by Eastern music, mythology, and travels. At ten and a half minutes, it is one of the group's longest studio recordings and one of their most complex, with different interwoven sections and multiple overdubbed guitar parts. It was released in March 1976 as the opening track for their seventh studio album, Presence. The song received positive reviews, with comparisons to other epic-style Led Zeppelin songs, such as "" Kashmir "". Between 1977 and 1980, it was a feature of the group's concerts and a live performance from 1979 is included on the Led Zeppelin DVD (2003). In several interviews, Page named it as his favourite Led Zeppelin piece and places his guitar solo on a par with "" Stairway to Heaven "". ","Jimmy Page | member of | Led Zeppelin

264,Toyota Avalon,"The Toyota Avalon is a full-size car produced by Toyota in the United States, and is Toyota's largest front-wheel-drive sedan in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, and the Middle East. It was also produced in Australia from April 2000 until June 2005, when it was replaced in November 2006 by the Toyota Aurion. The first production Avalon rolled off the TMMK assembly line in Georgetown, Kentucky, in September 1994. A second-generation model was released in the United States and Japan in 1999. Toyota marketed the Avalon as a replacement for the Toyota Cressida, a model discontinued for the American market in 1992. While the Cressida was an upper-level midsize rear-wheel-drive car with a straight-six engine, the Avalon is front-wheel-drive, powered by a V6 engine. In recent years, there has been considerable overlapping with its platform mates, the Toyota Camry V6 and the Lexus ES, although the third-generation Avalon was distinguished by offering extra legroom. For its fourth generation, the Avalon was introduced on a platform that is shared with the Lexus ES. As of 2013, the Toyota Avalon is available in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and the Middle East. Avalon is a legendary island featured in the Arthurian legend, fitting it in with Toyota's tradition of naming their sedans the word for "" crown "" in various languages (Crown, Corona, Camry, Corolla), types of crowns (Tiara), or other things associated with royalty (Scepter).

266,Cranford Agreement,"The Cranford Protocol or Cranford Agreement was an oral undertaking given in 1952 by the British Government to the residents of Cranford in London regarding the usage of the runways at London Heathrow Airport to reduce the impact of aircraft noise on local residents. Under normal operations the agreement prohibited take-off on the northern runway towards the east (over London) because of the proximity of Cranford to the east end of this runway ; however this runway could be used in exceptional cases, for example when the southern runway was not available for departures or when departure delays are excessive. Although no formal written agreement exists, the Government acknowledges that an oral undertaking was given by a senior government official at a meeting of the Cranford Residents ' and District Amenities Association on 31 July 1952. The protocol is included in the Heathrow Manual of Air Traffic Services and the airport's noise abatement notification, and thus is a part of the airport's operating rules. On 15 January 2009, the Labour Government announced that it was ending the Cranford Agreement as part of the controversial expansion of London Heathrow Airport. Although in May 2010 the Coalition Government cancelled the Heathrow expansion plans, in September 2010 it reaffirmed the decision to end the Cranford Agreement. This decision was welcomed by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, to the west. To the east, the London Borough of Hounslow called for mitigation or compensation to be offered by BAA to those affected by ending the Cranford Agreement. In May 2013 Heathrow Airport Holdings (who own and operate the airport) submitted planning permission to the London Borough of Hillingdon to build new access taxiways, which would allow the implementation of full runway alternation on easterly operations. This permission was rejected in March 2014 ; Heathrow Airport appealed with a planning enquiry in June 2015. On 2 February 2017 the Planning Inspectorate recommended that the appeal be allowed and planning permission granted. The decision has not yet been implemented as the airport is considering the Governments airspace management proposals for London and their own plans for expansion.

270,Burseraceae,"The Burseraceae are a moderate-sized family of 17-19 genera and about 540 species of flowering plants. The actual numbers differ according to the time period in which a given source is written describing this family. The Burseraceae are also known as the torchwood family, the frankincense and myrrh family, or simply the incense tree family. The family includes both trees and shrubs, and is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Just as the family size (in terms of genera and species) differs according to the time period of the study, so, too, does its placement in the higher ranks. Nevertheless, the family is a genetically supported monophyletic group currently and frequently cited within the Sapindales and is recognized as a sister group to the Anacardiaceae. The Burseraceae are characterized by the nonallergenic resin they produce in virtually all plant tissue and the distinctive smooth, yet flaking, aromatic bark. The origins of the family can be traced to the Paleocene (about 65 Mya) when Beiselia mexicana first diverged in Mexico. The subsequent divergences in the family lineage and migration of the species in the Eocene (53 Mya) from North America have led to the current distributions of the species that are primarily associated with the tropics. Though the family likely originated in North America, the greatest generic diversity presently is in the Southern Hemisphere. Tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa) and gumbo limbo (Bursera simaruba) represent the economic, ethnobotanical, and ecological significance of the Burseraceae in the Western Hemisphere, while frankincense (Boswellia sacra) and myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) represent the same in the Eastern Hemisphere.

272,Economic history of Cambodia,"Cambodia was a farming area in the first and second millennia BC. States in the area engaged in trade in the Indian Ocean and exported rice surpluses. Complex irrigation systems were built in the 9th century. The French colonial period left the large feudal landholdings intact. Roads and a railway were built, and rubber, rice and corn grown. After independence Sihanouk pursued a policy of economic independence, securing aid and investment from a number of countries. Bombing and other effects of the war during the Vietnam War damaged rice production. Lon Nol had a policy of liberalising the economy. This was followed by the victory of the Khmer Rouge and the emptying of the cities. After the defeat of the Khmer Rouge, a Five Year Plan was adopted, aiming to improve agriculture, industry and distribution, with a slogan of "" export and thrift "". Today, Cambodia remains a largely agricultural economy and industrial development is slow. ","Lon Nol | country of citizenship | Cambodia

273,FLAMA,"The Frente de Libertao do Arquiplago da Madeira (), or FLAMA (which could be read as an archaic Portuguese word for "" flame "", flama), was a right-wing terrorist paramilitary organisation from Madeira, whose main goal was to achieve Madeira's independence from mainland Portugal. FLAMA carried out more than 70 armed and bomb attacks between 1974-1976, during the revolutionary period that followed the Portuguese Carnation Revolution (April 25, 1974). The Carnation Revolution effectively changed the Portuguese regime from an authoritarian dictatorship (the Estado Novo) to a democracy (the Third Republic), but only after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (Processo Revolucionrio Em Curso, Portuguese for Ongoing Revolutionary Process), characterized by social turmoil and power dispute between left and right wing political forces. During this period the new government withdrew from Angola and Mozambique, the last Portuguese colonies on mainland Africa. Some in Madeira thought that their area should be the next to separate. FLAMA's demands were more a right-wing political reaction by some of the regional elites to the left-wing nature of the Revolution and its main actors, than a truly ethnic or nationalist separatist goal. After the normalization of the Portuguese political system, early in 1976, and the constitutional grant of autonomy to the Portuguese North Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and Azores (where a similar organization existed, the Frente de Libertao dos Aores), the organization vanished. Allegedly one of FLAMA's most important activists was the controversial Alberto Joo Jardim, the former President of the regional government of Madeira, co-founder of the Madeiran branch of the popular centre-right-wing Portuguese party PSD and former Vice-president of the European People's Party.

274,Guillermo Endara,"Guillermo David Endara Galimany (May 12, 1936  September 28, 2009) was President of Panama from 1989 to 1994. Raised in a family allied to Panameista Party founder Arnulfo Arias, Endara attended school in exile in the United States and Argentina following Arias's removal from power. Endara later received a law degree in Panama. He subsequently served as a member of Panama's National Assembly, and briefly as a government minister before heading into exile again following Arias ' third overthrow. After Arias ' death in 1988, Endara became a leading opponent of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship, heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque, the results were annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions. The assaults received widespread coverage in international media, helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega. Seven months later, the United States invaded Panama. Endara was sworn in as the new president on the first night of the invasion on a U.S. military base. During his presidency, Endara abolished the Panamanian military and replaced it with a national police force. Endara's term saw steady economic growth and a return of democratic institutions, but also high unemployment rates. His administration was marked by internal fighting, and his popularity plummeted. He was succeeded by opposition candidate Ernesto Prez Balladares on September 1, 1994. Endara ran for office again in 2004 and 2009, but lost to Democratic Revolutionary Party candidate Martn Torrijos and to independent candidate Ricardo Martinelli. He died of a heart attack on September 28, 2009, several months after his last campaign. ","Guillermo David Endara Galimany | date of death | September 28, 2009

276,Abbas Kiarostami,"Abbas Kiarostami (; 22 June 1940  4 July 2016) was an Iranian film director, screenwriter, poet, photographer and film producer. An active film-maker from 1970, Kiarostami had been involved in over forty films, including shorts and documentaries. Kiarostami attained critical acclaim for directing the Koker trilogy (1987  94), Close-Up (1990), Taste of Cherry (1997)  which was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival that year  and The Wind Will Carry Us (1999). In his later works, Certified Copy (2010) and Like Someone in Love (2012), he filmed for the first time outside Iran : in Italy and Japan, respectively. Kiarostami had worked extensively as a screenwriter, film editor, art director and producer and had designed credit titles and publicity material. He was also a poet, photographer, painter, illustrator, and graphic designer. He was part of a generation of filmmakers in the Iranian New Wave, a Persian cinema movement that started in the late 1960s and includes pioneering directors such as Bahram Beyzai, Nasser Taghvai, Ali Hatami, Masoud Kimiai, Dariush Mehrjui, Sohrab Shahid-Saless and Parviz Kimiavi. These filmmakers share many common techniques including the use of poetic dialogue and allegorical storytelling dealing with political and philosophical issues. Kiarostami had a reputation for using child protagonists, for documentary-style narrative films, for stories that take place in rural villages, and for conversations that unfold inside cars, using stationary mounted cameras. He is also known for his use of Persian poetry in the dialogue, titles, and themes of his films. Kiarostami's films contain a notable degree of ambiguity, an unusual mixture of simplicity and complexity, and often a mix of fictional and documentary elements. The concepts of change and continuity, in addition to the themes of life and death, play a major role in Kiarostami's works. ","Abbas Kiarostami | country of citizenship | Iran

277,Tomcats Screaming Outside,"Tomcats Screaming Outside is the first (and to date only) solo album from British musician Roland Orzabal of the group Tears for Fears, and was released on 2 April 2001. Although Orzabal had effectively made two solo albums under the Tears for Fears moniker in the 1990s (following the departure of bandmate Curt Smith), this was the first recording to be released under his own name. This album was Orzabal's last to feature contributions from Alan Griffiths, who co-wrote most of the tracks on this album as well as the previous two Tears for Fears albums. The album was given a low-key release and did not chart, but earned some critical acclaim for its clever melding of pop songwriting and drum ' n bass, ambient techno and trip hop textures. Dan Gennoe claimed in Amazon.com's editorial review : "" Solo album or not, Tomcats Screaming Outside is the best Tears for Fears album in a decade. "" In a 2000 interview Orzabal commented on his influences for the album : "" I started out with an absolute concrete vision of where I wanted to go so I started with a very different rhythm approach, with drum and bass / jungle... and I ended up with something that was n't the original plan. "" The US release of the album (on Gold Circle Records) had the unfortunate coincidence to be released on September 11, 2001 the same day the United States experienced its worst-ever terrorist attack, and drew little notice outside TFF's core fan base.

281,Pskhu,"Pskhu (, Pskhu ;, Ps'hwy ;, Pskhu) is a village in the Sukhumi district of Abkhazia, a disputed region on the Black Sea coast. Its population was about 150 (as of 2005) with ethnic Russians constituting a majority. The village is situated in the eponymous valley between the Greater Caucasus and Bzyb ranges. The river Bzyb and several of its tributaries flow near the village. The valley was inhabited by the Abazins tribe which was one of the last peoples of the Caucasus to be conquered by Russia. After their subjection in 1864 almost all of them escaped to Turkey ; many perished at the Black sea coast from hunger and malaria, during the transportation to Ottoman Empire. Pskhu was the only settlement in the Transcaucasia to be occupied by Wehrmacht during the Battle of the Caucasus of World War II in the autumn of 1942. The small hydro-electric power station supplies the energy to the village. Pskhu also has an airport with grass-covered surface. There are no regular flights although it is still used occasionally by tourists and by the local inhabitants. Several dolmens and the ruins of the mediaeval fortress remained near Pskhu. The nearby Inal-kuba (Pskhu-Nykha) mountain (1290 m) is one of the seven shrines of the Abkhaz people. ","Sukhumi | located in or next to body of water | Black Sea coast

282,Cassin's finch,"Cassin's finch (Haemorhous cassinii) is a bird in the finch family, Fringillidae. This species and the other "" American rosefinches "" are placed in the genus Haemorhous. Adults have a short forked brown tail and brown wings. They have a longer bill than the purple finch. Adult males are raspberry red on the head, breast, back and rump ; their back and undertail are streaked. Adult females have light brown upperparts and light underparts with brown streaks throughout ; their facial markings are less distinct than those of the female purple finch. Their breeding habitat is coniferous forest in mountains of western North America as far south as northern New Mexico and Arizona ; also Southern California near Baja California. They nest in large conifers. They move to lower elevations in winter. Northernmost breeding birds migrate south, as do some birds throughout the range of the species ; many birds are permanent residents, however. Some non-breeding birds winter as far south as central interior Mexico. These birds forage in trees, sometimes in ground vegetation. They mainly eat seeds, buds and berries, some insects. When not nesting, they often feed in small flocks. This bird was named after John Cassin, who was a curator at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. ","North America | has part | New Mexico

285,Mendenhall Glacier,"Mendenhall Glacier (also Sitaantaagu) is a glacier about long located in Mendenhall Valley, about from downtown Juneau in the southeast area of the U.S. state of Alaska. The glacier and surrounding landscape is protected as part of the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area, a federally designated unit of the Tongass National Forest. The Juneau Icefield Research Program has monitored the outlet glaciers of the Juneau Icefield since 1942, including Mendenhall Glacier. The glacier has also retreated since 1929, when Mendenhall Lake was created, and over since 1500. The end of the glacier currently has a negative glacier mass balance and will continue to retreat in the foreseeable future. Given that average yearly temperatures are currently increasing, and the outlook is for this trend to continue, it is actually possible that the glacier might experience a period of stabilization or slight advance during its retreating march. This is because increasing amounts of warm, moist air will be carried up to the head of the icefield, where colder ambient temperatures will cause it to precipitate as snow. The increased amount of snow will feed the icefield, possibly enough to offset the continually increasing melting experienced at the glacier's terminus. However, this interesting phenomenon will fade away if temperatures continue to climb, since the head of the glacier will no longer have cold enough ambient temperatures to cause snow to precipitate.

The engagement was part of Prince Eugene of Savoy's campaign to seize the Spanish controlled Duchy of Milan in the Italian peninsula, and had followed his victory over Marshal Catinat at the Battle of Carpi in July. Marshal Villeroi replaced Catinat as commander of the Franco  Spanish  Savoyard forces in the theatre, carrying with him orders from King Louis XIV to push the Imperialists out of Italy. Foreseeing Villeroi's intention of attacking at any price, Eugene entrenched himself in front of the small fortress of Chiari, and waited for the attack. In a battle that lasted several hours the Austrians inflicted heavy casualties on Villeroi's forces, gaining an overwhelming victory. The campaign established Eugene in Lombardy, and helped to persuade the Maritime Powers to come to the aid of the Emperor. Within a week of the battle England, the Dutch Republic, and Leopold I, had signed the second treaty of the Grand Alliance. ","Battle of Chiari | point in time | 1 September 1701

287,Washington v. Texas,"Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14 (1967), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided that the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution (guaranteeing the right of a criminal defendant to force the attendance of witnesses for their side) is applicable in state courts as well as federal courts. Jackie Washington had attempted to call his co-defendant as a witness, but was blocked by Texas courts because state law prevented co-defendants from testifying for each other, under the theory that they would be likely to lie for each other on the stand. The Supreme Court reasoned that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment made the right to be able to compel defense witnesses to testify necessary for a defendant's "" due process "" rights to fair proceedings, which applies to the states. Only Justice John Marshall Harlan II parted from the Court's "" due process "" focus, though he agreed with the outcome, as he regularly did in cases involving whether to apply federal rights to state courts. The impact of Washington was narrowed by a later case, Taylor v. Illinois (1988), in which the Court said that "" countervailing public interests "", like the need to move through cases quickly, could be balanced against a defendant's right to present witnesses. In Taylor, the Supreme Court upheld a judge's order blocking defense witnesses from testifying due to the defense attorney's deliberate failure to disclose evidence to prosecutors earlier in the trial. The defense attorney's actions resulted in a lengthy delay in the proceedings which the trial judge felt was unjustified. Legal scholars have seen this new grant of discretion to trial judges as a change to relying on "" efficient justice "", a more limited vision of trial rights than the "" right to present a defense "" created in Washington.

289,Carl Buchheister,"Carl Buchheister (17 October 1890  2 February 1964) was a German constructivist artist noted for his multiple series of "" model paintings "" at Galerie Lambert Weyl, Paris. which he began in 1925. He was born in Hanover, Germany. Although he was not officially part of the Bauhaus movement, Buchheister was a close friend of Wassily Kandinsky and paralleled many of the social and artistic goals of the Bauhaus school. With regard to constructivism, Buchheister was typically more playful and improvisational than his contemporaries, becoming interested in the Dada movement after a collaboration with Kurt Schwitters in the late 1920s which led him to incorporate more varied materials such as acrylic glass, aluminum, wood, and twine into his compositions. This direction was given much freer rein after World War II and the end of Nazism. He died in Hanover in 1964. ","Hanover | country | Germany

293,Signaling of the New York City Subway,"In the New York metropolitan area, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) runs the New York City Subway, which is mostly manually operated. The subway system currently uses Automatic Block Signaling with fixed wayside signals and automatic train stops. Many portions of the signaling system were installed between the 1930s and 1960s. Because of the age of the subway system, some replacement parts must be custom built for the MTA, as they are otherwise unavailable from signaling suppliers. Additionally, some subway services have reached their train capacity limits and can not operate extra trains with the current system. There are two different schemes of signaling in the system. The most used scheme is found on all of the B Division, which consists of lines originally built to the Brooklyn  Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) and Independent Subway System (IND)'s wider specifications, as well as on most of the A Division, which consists of lines built to the narrower specifications of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). An older system was used on all of the A Division, but with the conversion of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line signals to the B Division scheme, this system is no longer in use. As part of the modernization of the New York City Subway, the MTA has plans to upgrade much of the system with communications-based train control (CBTC) technology, which will control the speed and starting and stopping of subway trains. The CBTC system is mostly automated and uses a moving block system  which reduces headways between trains, increases train frequencies and capacities, and relays the trains ' positions to a control room  rather than a fixed block system. This will require new rolling stock to be built for the subway system, as only newer trains can use CBTC. ","Metropolitan Transportation Authority | headquarters location | New York

295,Liang Congjie,"Liang Congjie (; 4 August 1932  28 October 2010) was a Chinese historian best known for his work as an environmental activist who established the Friends of Nature in 1994 as the first environmental non-governmental organization to be officially recognized by the government of the People's Republic of China. Liang's father, architect Liang Sicheng, had led attempts to prevent the destruction of the walls surrounding Beijing with the land to be used for the construction of highways. His grandfather Liang Qichao spent 14 years in exile in Japan after he advocated on behalf of turning the Qing Dynasty into a constitutional monarchy. His ancestry came to haunt him during the Maoist Cultural Revolution when he was purged for his being the "" grandson of China's biggest royalist "". Liang was ultimately able to attend Peking University. Having learned about the activities of Greenpeace, Liang and three of his colleagues at the Academy for Chinese Culture came to agreement that a corresponding organization was required in China to address growing environmental concerns in that country. The group that they formed, Friends of Nature, eschewed Greenpeace's more confrontational techniques, choosing to develop grassroots concern about nature through fostering environmental awareness in schools and establishing the nation's first birdwatching group. The organization worked with the Chinese government to ensure enforcement of existing environmental law, including efforts to protect a Tibetan antelope which were on the path to extinction and videotaping the cutting stands of old-growth forest in Western China that led to a 1999 order by Zhu Rongji prohibiting cutting down such trees. Environmentalist Ma Jun described Liang as having "" incubated the first generation of environmentalists in China "" and described how he worked in conjunction with the government on a "" constructively critical "" basis to build support for protecting the environment. Friends of Nature's Li Bo credited him with "" promoting ordinary Chinese's participation in supervising pollution problems and protecting the environment "". Liang was recognized in 2000 with the Ramon Magsaysay Award, which recognizes Asian contributions to public service, noting that he was able to push environmental issues while having "" avoided the pitfall of alienating government "". Liang died at the age of 78 on October 28, 2010, due to a lung infection while at a hospital in Beijing. He was survived by his wife, a daughter and a son.

296,Pleistocene coyote,"The Pleistocene coyote (Canis latrans orcutti), also known as the Ice Age coyote, is an extinct subspecies of coyote that lived in western North America during the Late Pleistocene era. Most remains of the subspecies were found in southern California, though at least one was discovered in Idaho. It was part of a carnivore guild that included other canids like foxes, gray wolves, and dire wolves. Compared to their modern Holocene counterparts, Pleistocene coyotes were larger and more robust, weighing, likely in response to larger competitors and prey rather than Bergmann's rule. Their skulls and jaws were significantly thicker and deeper than in modern coyotes, with a shorter and broader rostrum and wider carnassial (denoting the large upper premolar and lower molar teeth of a carnivore, adapted for shearing flesh) teeth. These adaptions allowed it to cope with higher levels of stress, when it killed larger prey, compared to modern coyotes. Pleistocene coyotes were also likely more specialized carnivores than their descendants, as their teeth were more adapted to shearing meat, showing fewer grinding surfaces which were better suited for processing vegetation. The lower jaw was also deeper, and the molars showed more signs of wear and breakage than modern populations, thus indicating that the animals consumed more bone than today. Behaviorally, it is likely to have been more social than the modern coyote, as its remains are the third most common in the La Brea Tar Pits, after dire wolves and sabre-toothed cats, both thought to be gregarious species. Their reduction in size occurred within 1,000 years of the occurrence of the Quaternary extinction event, when the climate changed and the majority of their larger prey became extinct. Furthermore, Pleistocene coyotes were unable to successfully exploit the big game hunting niche left vacant after the extinction of the dire wolf, as that gap was rapidly filled by gray wolves. These gray wolves are likely to have actively killed off the larger-bodied coyotes, with natural selection favoring the modern gracile morph. Human predation on the Pleistocene coyote's dwindling prey base may have also impacted the animal's change in morphology. ","California | continent | North America

He was a younger son of John of Luxembourg, Lord of Beauvoir and Marguerite of Enghien. Lewis was elected archbishop of Rouen in 1436. He was the leading native administrator / collaborator with the Lancastrian regime in France. As its position weakened, his own fortunes and even personal safety became precarious. Although the city of Rouen did not fall to Charles VII of France until late 1449, well after Luxembourg's death, Henry VI's government had long ago decided he needed and deserved remuneration and status based more securely in England. Thus he was provided to Ely ' in commendam ' on 27 September 1437. This was the fifth wealthiest see in England, yet also amongst the smallest in terms of size or burden. He is not known ever to have visited it. He died on 18 September 1443. ","Lewis of Luxembourg | date of death | 1443

301,"San Pablito, Puebla","San Pablito is a small town located on the side of the Guajalote Mountain in the Sierra Norte de Puebla mountain region in central east Mexico. It belongs to the Pahuatln municipality of the state of Puebla. Culturally it is dominated by the Otomi although it is part of the La Huasteca region. San Pablito is best known for the commercial production of a bark paper called amate as a handcraft. This paper is mostly sold to Nahua painters in Guerrero, but it is also sold nationally and internationally on its own. The paper is made much the way it was before the arrival of the Spanish. Originally, it was made only by the area's shamans for ritual purpose but today commercial production is mostly done by the town's women and children as many men have left to work in the United States.

302,École des officiers de la gendarmerie nationale,"L'cole des officiers de la gendarmerie nationale, the French Gendarmerie nationale Officers School, was created in 1901 and based in the Schomberg barracks in Paris. At the time it was simply to give additional training to NCOs likely to enter the officer corps. In 1918, following the First World War, the school moved to Versailles and diversified by including in its ranks officers from other armies. It was not until 1937 that the school was given a flag. This emblem was officially handed over to the chef de corps, Colonel Picot, 14 July 1937, on the Champs-lyses by the President Albert Lebrun. During the Second World War, the school moved to Pau then back to Paris before finding its current home in the Augereau barracks in Melun on 1 October 1945.

303,French Resistance,"The French Resistance () was the collection of French movements that fought against the Nazi German occupation of France and against the collaborationist Vichy rgime during the Second World War. Resistance cells were small groups of armed men and women (called the Maquis in rural areas), who, in addition to their guerrilla warfare activities, were also publishers of underground newspapers, providers of first-hand intelligence information, and maintainers of escape networks that helped Allied soldiers and airmen trapped behind enemy lines. The men and women of the Resistance came from all economic levels and political leanings of French society, including migrs, academics, students, aristocrats, conservative Roman Catholics (including priests), and also citizens from the ranks of liberals, anarchists and communists. The French Resistance played a significant role in facilitating the Allies ' rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, and the lesser-known invasion of Provence on 15 August, by providing military intelligence on the German defences known as the Atlantic Wall and on Wehrmacht deployments and orders of battle. The Resistance also planned, coordinated, and executed acts of sabotage on the electrical power grid, transport facilities, and telecommunications networks. It was also politically and morally important to France, both during the German occupation and for decades afterward, because it provided the country with an inspiring example of the patriotic fulfillment of a national imperative, countering an existential threat to French nationhood. The actions of the Resistance stood in marked contrast to the collaboration of the French regime based at Vichy, the French people who joined the pro-Nazi Milice franaise and the French men who joined the Waffen SS. After the landings in Normandy and Provence, the paramilitary components of the Resistance were organised more formally, into a hierarchy of operational units known, collectively, as the French Forces of the Interior (FFI). Estimated to have a strength of 100,000 in June 1944, the FFI grew rapidly and reached approximately 400,000 by October of that year. Although the amalgamation of the FFI was, in some cases, fraught with political difficulties, it was ultimately successful, and it allowed France to rebuild the fourth-largest army in the European theatre (1.2 million men) by VE Day in May 1945.

304,Independence Pass (Colorado),"Independence Pass, originally known as Hunter Pass, is a high mountain pass in the Rocky Mountains of central Colorado in the United States. It is at elevation on the Continental Divide in the Sawatch Range. The pass is midway between Aspen and Twin Lakes, on the border between Pitkin and Lake counties. State Highway 82 traverses it, in the process reaching the highest elevation of a paved Colorado state highway on a through road. After Cottonwood Pass to the south, it is the second-highest pass with an improved road in the state, the fourth-highest paved road in the state and the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in the U.S. Because of the heavy snowfall at its elevation, it is closed in wintertime, isolating Aspen from direct access from the east during the ski season. When the pass is open in warmer weather, it is a popular destination. A scenic overlook near the pass allows visitors to take in the alpine tundra environment above treeline, and offers excellent views to the east of Mount Elbert, Colorado's highest peak and the second-highest mountain in the contiguous United States. Rock climbers are drawn to nearby bouldering opportunities, and informal paths lead to nearby mountain summits of even higher elevation. Backcountry skiers make use of the slopes during the late spring and early summer. Since 2011 the pass has been on the route of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge. The pass was formed by glacial action and erosion in the region, and its first recorded sighting was by Zebulon Pike in 1806. Ferdinand Hayden surveyed it in 1873. As part of the Continental Divide, it was the limit of European settlement in the region at the time, with the land to the west reserved for the Ute people. Prospectors who defied governor Frederick Walker Pitkin's order crossed the pass on July 4, 1879, giving it its current name and setting up a similarly named village (now a ghost town) to its west. A toll road built across the pass was abandoned and neglected after a railroad connection was made to Aspen. A new road replaced it in the 1920s ; portions of the old route can still be seen along the western approach. The Independence Pass Foundation, based in Aspen, works to repair damage to the pass's environment caused by both roads since 1984.

At that time the lake was a marsh known as Rice Lake, but over four years, the park system transformed the wetland into a lake surrounded by a park. The lake and park have a fishing dock, wading pool, tennis courts, and softball diamonds. There is a recreation center that hosts activities. The lake borders a municipal golf course. In the winter the park sets up ice and hockey rinks. There is a bike and walking path starting at Lake Hiawatha which veers onto Lake Nokomis or winds down the Minnehaha Creek right to the mouth of the Minnehaha Falls. Lake Hiawatha is one of the few lakes through which Minnehaha Creek flows, and the last one before it reaches Minnehaha Falls and then the Mississippi River. Friends of Lake Hiawatha is a community environmental action group that organizes volunteer efforts to clean the lake and park.

309,Francesco De Masi,"Francesco De Masi (11 January 1930  6 November 2005) was an Italian conductor and film score composer. He studied composition at the San Pietro a Maiella Conservatory in Naples, under the guidance of Achille Longo, his uncle. De Masi became interested in film music when Longo was asked to compose a soundtrack for a film, and he asked De Masi to be his assistant. De Masi's filmography includes scores for over 200 films and TV series, ranging from spaghetti westerns and sword and sandal epics to gialli and horror films, such as Lucio Fulci's Lo squartatore di New York (The New York Ripper). De Masi also scored several action films, such as Enzo G. Castellari's Quel maledetto treno blindato (The Inglorious Bastards), but he is best remembered for his work on spaghetti westerns. Unlike most other composers, De Masi started writing western scores slightly earlier than the genre's most influential musician, Ennio Morricone. As De Masi's music was less influenced by Morricone, his style had a distinctive sound. Many of his songs were performed by the low-voiced member of the I Cantori Moderni choir, Ettore "" Raoul "" Lovecchio. De Masi was also very interested in classical music. He taught at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory, also conducting the conservatory's orchestra. In an interview, De Masi listed Palestrina, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Ravel and Shostakovich as his main classical influences. De Masi died of cancer at the age of 75.

Since 2000 Belmopan has been one of two settlements in Belize to hold official city status, along with Belize City. Belmopan is located in Cayo District at an altitude of above sea level. Belmopan was constructed just to the east of the Belize River, inland from the former capital, the port of Belize City, after that city's near destruction by Hurricane Hattie in 1961. The government was moved to Belmopan in 1970. Its National Assembly Building is designed to resemble a Pre-Columbian Maya temple. ","Belmopan | country | Belize

311,Robert Burns Fellowship,"The Robert Burns Fellowship, established in 1958 as a bicentennial celebration, is claimed to be New Zealand's premier literary residency. The list of past fellows includes many of New Zealand's most notable writers. The award was established by an anonymous group (thought to have been instigated by Charles Brasch) to be awarded each year to "" writers of imaginative literature, including poetry, drama, fiction, autobiography, biography, essays or literary criticism. "" The position is based at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. It provides a year's salary along with accommodation and an office for a writer in and around the university. Terms are for one year, although this may be extended to a second year in rare cases. The Robert Burns Fellowship is named after Scotland's national poet Robert Burns. Dunedin is the city in New Zealand with the highest proportion of people of Scottish descent, and one of its founding fathers was Burns's nephew Thomas Burns. To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the fellowship, a book-Nurse to the imagination : Fifty years of the Robert Burns Fellowship-was launched in October 2008, along with commemorations to coincide with Dunedin's 2008 Arts Festival.

313,"John of Islay, Earl of Ross","John of Islay (or John MacDonald) (1434  1503) was a late medieval Scottish magnate. He was Earl of Ross and the 4th Lord of the Isles as well as being Mac Domhnaill, chief of Clan Donald. John would however prove to be the last of the Lords of the Isles, overmighty subjects of the Stewart Kings of Scotland and virtual kings in their own right in the Western Isles. His struggle for power with King James III of Scotland ended in humiliation, following which his illegitimate son Angus g rebelled against his rule. In a bitter civil war, John's fleet of galleys met those of Angus sometime in the early 1480s off the coast of Mull at the Battle of Bloody Bay, in which John's cause was defeated. After Bloody Bay he became an inconsequential figure ; and Angus continued to dominate the affairs of Clan Donald up until his murder in 1490. In 1493 James IV brought the Lordship of the Isles to an end. John died unlamented in 1503, having witnessed the almost complete destruction of his family inheritance.

314,The Hub (band),"The Hub is an American "" computer network music "" ensemble formed in 1986 consisting of John Bischoff, Tim Perkis, Chris Brown, Scot Gresham-Lancaster, Mark Trayle and Phil Stone. "" The Hub was the first live computer music band whose members were all composers, as well as designers and builders of their own hardware and software. "" The Hub grew from the League of Automatic Music Composers : John Bischoff, Tim Perkis, Jim Horton, and Rich Gold. Perkis and Bischoff modified their equipment for a performance at The Network Muse Festival in 1986 at The LAB in San Francisco. Instead of creating an ad-hoc wired connection of computer interaction, they decided to use a hub-a general purpose connection for network data. This was less failure-prone and enabled greater collaborations. The Hub was the first band to do a telematic performance in 1987 at the Clocktower in New York. Since this work represents some of the earliest work in the context of the new live music practice of Networked music performance, they have been cited as the archetypal network ensemble in computer music. The Hub's best-known piece, Stuck Note by Scot Gresham-Lancaster has been covered by a number of network music bands, including MiLO- the Milwaukee Laptop Orchestra and BiLE- the Birmingham Laptop Ensemble. They have collaborated with Rova Saxophone Quartet, Nick Collins, Phill Niblock, and Alvin Curran. They currently perform around the world after a multi-year hiatus, ending in 2004.

Ambassadorships are often used as a form of political patronage to reward high-profile or important supporters of the President. The most visible ambassadorships are often distributed either in this way or to the President's ideological or partisan confreres. Most ambassadorships, however, are assigned to Foreign Service Officers who have spent their career in the State Department. Regardless, all ambassadors must be formally appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. While all ambassadors serve at the president's pleasure and may be dismissed at any time, career diplomats usually serve tours of roughly three years before receiving a new assignment, and political appointees customarily tender their resignations upon the inauguration of a new president.

317,Yi Seok,"Yi Seok (born 3 August 1941) is the nominal King of Joseon as the head of the House of Yi, the Korean royal family. He was described as "" the last prince still living on Korean soil, the last pretender to an abolished throne "" by The New York Times. Yi gained fame as the "" singing prince "" with the wedding favorite "" Pigeon House "", released in 1967. Since 2004, he has been employed by the city of Jeonju to promote tourism. He is also a professor of history at Jeonju University. He is a son of Prince Yi Kang, the fifth son of Emperor Gojong of Korea, and his thirteenth wife, Lady Hong Chng-sun, a former telephone operator. Currently, Yi Seok resides in a building renovated for his use by the city of Jeonju, 243 kilometers south of Seoul. The city government hopes that Seok's settlement on the grounds of its Hanok Village will spotlight the historic significance of the city and help it to attract tourists. As part of this arrangement, Seok gives lectures to Jeonju visitors about Korean history. He also frequently lectures elsewhere and is often called upon for ceremonial duties, despite his official status as a private citizen. Recently, Seok authored a book about the late Joseon Dynasty royal court family and has founded an organization, which he now leads, "" The Imperial Grandson Association "", dedicated to preserving the culture of the royal court. The Republic of Korea owned website, Korea.net, recognizes King Yi Seok as the only remaining heir in Korea. ","House of Yi | part of | Korea

318,Christopher Franke,"Christopher Franke (born 6 April 1953, Berlin) is a German musician and composer. From 1971 to 1987 he was a member of the electronic group Tangerine Dream. Initially a drummer with The Agitation, later renamed Agitation Free, his primary focus eventually shifted to keyboards and synthesizers as the group moved away from its psychedelic rock origins. While he was not the first musician to use an analog sequencer, he was probably the first to turn it into a live performance instrument, thus laying the rhythmic foundation for classic Tangerine Dream pieces and indeed for the whole Berlin school sound. After his departure from the group, he founded the Sonic Images record label, a new-age music label called Earthtone and the Berlin Symphonic Film Orchestra, and produced a number of solo music works. After leaving Tangerine Dream, his only live concert was on 9 October 1991 at the Astoria Theatre in London. He performed on stage with Edgar Rothermich (a.k.a. Richard E. Roth) who is also his producer and engineer on all his solo projects and film music after 1990. Franke moved to Los Angeles in 1991 to pursue film work. In 1995 he scored the AFI short Requiem. He may be best known for composing the music for the science fiction television series Babylon 5, as well as the score of the anime movie Tenchi Muyo ! in Love and in 2005 the music for German musical Ludwig (with Konstantin Wecker).

The name  a conflation of Wellington and Hollywood  is a reference to the film production business established in the city by The Lord of the Rings film director Sir Peter Jackson, and Wellington-based special effects companies Weta Workshop and Weta Digital. The businesses operate a number of film-related facilities in the Wellington suburb of Miramar. In March 2010, the Wellington Airport company announced plans to erect a Hollywood-style sign Wellywood on a hillside next to the Miramar cutting. After the airport considered a range of alternatives, it was announced in May 2011 that the Wellywood sign would be going ahead. However this was met with enormous criticism, and on 1 June 2011 it was announced that a panel would be convened to consider alternative sign options. The panel ran a binding public poll on The Dominion Post website with the ' Wellington Blown Away ' design being chosen. The sign was erected 27 July 2012.

324,Flag of Prussia,"The state of Prussia had its origins in the separate lands of the Margraviate of Brandenburg and of the Duchy of Prussia. The Margraviate of Brandenburg developed from the medieval Northern March of the Holy Roman Empire, passing to the House of Hohenzollern in 1415. The Duchy of Prussia originated in 1525 when Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach, a member of a cadet branch of the Hohenzollerns, secularized the eastern lands of the Teutonic Knights as a Polish fief. Prince-elector John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg, inherited the Duchy of Prussia in 1618, thus uniting Brandenburg and Prussia under one ruler in a personal union ; the Elector's state became known as Brandenburg-Prussia. The Kingdom of Prussia formed when Elector Frederick III assumed the title of Frederick I, King in Prussia, on 18 January 1701. Hohenzollern monarchical rule of Prussia ceased in 1918 after the fall of the German Empire in the aftermath of World War I ; the Kingdom becoming instead the Free State of Prussia. The Allied Control Council decreed the formal abolition of the state of Prussia in 1947 following World War II. ","Kingdom of Prussia | follows | Duchy of Prussia

325,Nonconformist,"In English church history, a nonconformist was a Protestant who did not "" conform "" to the governance and usages of the established Church of England. Broad use of the term was precipitated after the Restoration of the British monarchy in 1660, when the Act of Uniformity 1662 re-established the opponents of reform within the Church of England. By the late 19th century the term specifically included the Reformed Christians (Presbyterians, Congregationalists and other Calvinist sects), plus the Baptists and Methodists. The English Dissenters such as the Puritans who violated the Act of Uniformity 1559typically by practising radical, sometimes separatist, dissent  were retrospectively labelled as nonconformists. By law and social custom, nonconformists were restricted from many spheres of public life  not least, from access to public office, civil service careers, or degrees at university  and were referred to as suffering from civil disabilities. In England and Wales in the late 19th century the new terms "" free churchman "" and "" Free Church "" started to replace "" dissenter "" or "" Nonconformist "". One influential nonconformist minister was Matthew Henry, who beginning in 1710 published his multi-volume Commentary that is still used and available in the 21st century. Isaac Watts is an equally recognized nonconformist minister whose hymns are still sung by Christians worldwide. ","Presbyterians | subclass of | Calvinist

329,The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist,"The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist, sometimes called The Burlington House Cartoon, is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci. The drawing is in charcoal and black and white chalk, on eight sheets of paper glued together. Because of its large size and format the drawing is presumed to be a cartoon for a painting. No painting by Leonardo exists that is based directly on this cartoon. The drawing depicts the Virgin Mary seated on the knees of her mother, St Anne, while holding the Child Jesus as Jesus ' young cousin, St. John the Baptist, stands to the right. It currently hangs in the National Gallery in London. It was either executed in around 1499  1500, at the end of the artist's first Milanese period, or around 1506  1508, when he was shuttling between Florence and Milan. The majority of scholars prefer the latter date, although the National Gallery and others prefer the former. ","Virgin Mary | mother | St Anne

332,Mono (software),"Mono is a free and open-source project to create an Ecma standard-compliant.NET Framework-compatible software framework, including a C # compiler and a Common Language Runtime. Originally by Ximian, it was later acquired by Novell, and is now being led by Xamarin, a subsidiary of Microsoft and the.NET Foundation. The stated purpose of Mono is not only to be able to run Microsoft.NET applications cross-platform, but also to bring better development tools to Linux developers. Mono can be run on many software systems including Android, most Linux distributions, BSD, macOS, Windows, Solaris, and even some game consoles such as PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360. The Mono project has been controversial within the open-source community, as it implements portions of.NET Framework that may be covered by Microsoft patents.

336,Load (album),"Load is the sixth studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released on June 4, 1996 by Elektra Records in the United States and by Vertigo Records internationally. The album showed more of a hard rock side of Metallica than the band's typical thrash metal style, which alienated much of the band's fanbase. It also featured influences from genres such as Southern rock, blues rock, country rock and alternative rock. Drummer Lars Ulrich said about Load more exploratory nature, "" This album and what we 're doing with it  that, to me, is what Metallica are all about : exploring different things. The minute you stop exploring, then just sit down and fucking die "". At 79 minutes, it is Metallica's longest studio album. Load debuted and spent four consecutive weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. Load sold 680,000 units in its first week, making it the biggest opening week for Metallica as well as the biggest debut of 1996. It was certified 5 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping five million copies in the United States. Four singles""Until It Sleeps "", "" Hero of the Day "", "" Mama Said "", and "" King Nothing "" were released as part of the marketing campaign for the album.

In the first Zuma administration he had been an MP and a controversial member of the Judicial Service Commission. He resigned as MP in 2017. Up to 2015 he was Minister of Mineral Resources. Ramatlhodi claimed in 2017 that Eskom chairperson Ben Ngubane and chief executive Brian Molefe requested that he terminate Glencor's mining licenses in an apparent ruse to facilitate the sale of its Optimum coal mine to the Gupta family. He was assigned to his subsequent ministerial post after he supposedly did not comply. He was axed in the cabinet reshuffle of March 2017, allegedly without being given reasons. His position was taken by a known Zuma ally, the then Free State economic development MEC Mosebenzi Zwane. In the same reshuffle, finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, were also replaced. ","Pravin Gordhan | country of citizenship | South Africa

338,Joseph R. Anderson,"Joseph Reid Anderson (February 16, 1813  September 7, 1892) was an American civil engineer, industrialist, politician and soldier. During the American Civil War he served as a Confederate general, and his Tredegar Iron Company was a major source of munitions and ordnance for the Confederate States Army. Starting with a small forge and rolling mill in the mid-1830s, It was a flourishing operation by 1843 when he leased it. He eventually bought the company outright in 1848 and forcefully and aggressively built Tredegar Iron Works into the South's largest and most significant iron works. When the Civil War broke out he entered the Army as a Brigadier General in 1861. Shortly after he was wounded and then resigned from the Army returning to the iron works. It was the Confederacy's major (and for much of the war only) source of cannons and munitions, employing some 900 workers, most of whom were slaves. His plant was confiscated by the Union army at the end of the war, but returned to him in 1867 and he remained president until his death. Anderson was very active in local civic and political affairs. ","Joseph Reid Anderson | military branch | Confederate States Army

340,Fyns Hoved,"Fyns Hoved is a bight of northeastern Funen, Denmark, curving south to form the approach to Odense Fjord. It is the northernmost point of Hindsholm and is thus Funen's northernmost point, dividing the Kattegat and the Great Belt. The eastern side of the bight between Fyns Hoved and Skoven, to the south, is irregular, with a beach and hills behind it, and to the south of the bight is a small, shallow bay, Korshavn Bay, with the Korshavn Light in the vicinity. The bay is a natural harbour used by many yachtsmen. Fyns Hoved is located in the dry Great Belt region, where rainfall is about per year compared to the national average of per year. This makes it hospitable to plants that are more common in the dry areas of southern Europe. The area is frequented by many shore birds and is also a resting place for migrating birds, and harbour porpoises can be seen offshore. Numerous artists such as Theodor Philipsen, Johannes Larsen and Fritz Syberg have found inspiration in the light and the scenery. There are many stone walls in the area ; these date back to 1810, when the seven farmers in the village of Nordskov decided to divide the area between them so that they would each have one northern and one southern strip of land. The seven cottagers had to content themselves with sharing one strip. During the German occupation, barracks, a radar installation and artillery on Fyns Hoved guarded the entrance to the Great Belt.

343,Triple-threat man,"In gridiron football, a triple-threat man is a player who excels at all three of the skills of running, passing, and kicking. In modern usage, such a player would be referred to as a utility player. Triple-threat men were the norm in the early days of football, as substitution rules were stringent. Thus, in addition to the need for passing, running, and kicking skills, they were also required to play defense. As injury awareness grew and substitution rules loosened, teams shifted to kicking specialists, which made the triple-threat man obsolete. One of the last triple-threat men in professional football was George Blanda, a quarterback and kicker who last played for the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League in 1975. Danny White, a quarterback and punter, retired in 1989. Since then, non-specialists have placekicked only extremely infrequently in the NFL. One instance occurred when Doug Flutie  also adept at both running and passing as a "" scrambling "" quarterback  drop kicked an extra point in 2006 during the last play of his career. Danny White of the Dallas Cowboys was the last non-specialist to kick on a regular basis, as he served as the team's starting quarterback and punter from 1980 until 1984, after several years as backup to Roger Staubach. There are, however, still dual-threat quarterbacks and wildcat halfbacks, who can both run and pass. A quarterback who played wide receiver in high school or college may sparingly catch passes or be converted into a wide receiver who occasionally passes. For over forty years the NFL single-season scoring record was held by a triple-threat man, Green Bay Packers Hall of Famer Paul Hornung. Hornung set a record of 176 points in 1960 by scoring fifteen touchdowns, kicking forty-one extra points, and also kicking fifteen field goals.

346,The Killers (Bukowski short story),""" The Killers "" is a short-story by Charles Bukowski collected in his 1973 collection South of No North, originally published by John Martin's Black Sparrow Press. The story elucidates Bukowski's publicly acknowledged artistic debt to Ernest Hemingway, the writer who had the most influence on American writers of Bukowksi's generation. Like "" The Killers "", Bukowski's story of the same name has as its thematic trope Murder in a nihilistic universe. Unlike Hemingway, the killers actually accomplish their act in the time-frame of the story. Bukowski's authorial point of view in his version of "" The Killers "" also is influenced by Hemingway, as he it be seen as a logical outgrowth of the attitude expressed by Hemingway's fictional alter-ego Nick Adams at the end of the 1927 "" Killers "" : Bukowski's fiction is full of attempts to escape the Los Angeles of his childhood and teen-years, all of which are doomed to failure as his fictional alter-ego, Henry Chinaski, finds the same appalling corruption everywhere he travels. In Bukowski's "" The Killers "", there is no escape for the murderers who are the protagonists of the story, mirroring the doomed boxer Ole Andreson in Hemingway's original.

347,"Józef Piłsudski Monument, Warsaw","The Jzef Pisudski Monument in Warsaw was erected to honor Jzef Pisudski, a military leader, Marshal of Poland and one of the main figures responsible for Poland's regaining its independence. This tall, bronze and granite statue is located near Pisudski's Square and the Hotel Europejski, at Tokarzewski-Karaszewicz Street. It bears the inscriptions "" Jzef Pisudski "" and "" Marshal of Poland "". Plans to raise the monument can be traced to 1990, when the president of Warsaw Stanisaw Wyganowski endorsed the request of a group campaigning for the creation of a monument to Pisudski. The monument, cast in the Polish Navy Shipyards, was unveiled on 14 August 1995, on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Warsaw, which was commanded by Pisudski. The unveiling was attended by the President of Poland, Lech Wasa, and Pisudski's daughter, Jadwiga Pisudska. The original plans called for the monument to be raised at Na Rozdrou Square, but were later modified to site it near the azienki. This decision was protested by the supporters of the monument, who declared the new location too minor, and the monument was moved to the current location. The current location has been and still is seen as controversial ; for example the statue's designer,, expressed his opposition to it in a letter shortly before the monument was unveiled, pointing out that it would cause the monument to be isolated from most ceremonies that take place on the square. Others have specifically criticized the fact that the location of the monument causes Polish soldiers to often face away from it during the guard change ceremony at the nearby Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, and during the observances for Polish Independence Day, which they regard as disrespectful.

The song was written by Lavigne, David Hodges, Chad Kroeger, Jacob Kasher Hindlin, Rickard B. Gransson and Peter Svensson and was produced by Peter Svensson. "" Rock n Roll "" is an upbeat pop punk song, and lyrically it is a declaration of rebellion on which the singer puts up her "" middle finger to the sky "" to "" let 'em know that she's still rock and roll, "" refusing to behave like an adult. The song received a critical praise from music critics, and was highlighted as one of the standout tracks on the album. "" Rock n Roll "" performed moderately on the charts, reaching number one in South Korea and Taiwan, and number five in Japan, respectively. The song failed to make impact elsewhere, peaking at number 37 in Canada and number 91 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.

355,Edmund Burke,"Edmund Burke (; 12 January [ NS ] 17309 July 1797) was an Irish statesman born in Dublin, as well as an author, orator, political theorist and philosopher, who after moving to London in 1750 served as a member of parliament (MP) between 1766 and 1794 in the House of Commons with the Whig Party. Burke was a proponent of underpinning virtues with manners in society and of the importance of religious institutions for the moral stability and good of the state. These views were expressed in his A Vindication of Natural Society. Burke criticized British treatment of the American colonies, including through its taxation policies. He also supported the rights of the colonists to resist metropolitan authority, though he opposed the attempt to achieve independence. Burke is remembered for his support for Catholic emancipation, the impeachment of Warren Hastings from the East India Company and for his staunch opposition to the French Revolution. In his Reflections on the Revolution in France, Burke asserted that the revolution was destroying the fabric of good society, traditional institutions of state and society and condemned the persecution of the Catholic Church that resulted from it. This led to his becoming the leading figure within the conservative faction of the Whig Party, which he dubbed the "" Old Whigs "", as opposed to the pro-French Revolution "" New Whigs "", led by Charles James Fox. In the nineteenth century, Burke was praised by both conservatives and liberals. Subsequently, in the twentieth century he became widely regarded as the philosophical founder of modern conservatism.

356,Russification of Finland,"The policy of Russification of Finland (Finnish : sortokaudet / sortovuodet-times / years of oppression) was a governmental policy of the Russian Empire aimed at limiting the special status of the Grand Duchy of Finland and possibly the termination of its political autonomy and cultural uniqueness in 1899  1905 and in 1908  1917. It was a part of a larger policy of Russification pursued by late 19th  early 20th century Russian governments which tried to abolish cultural and administrative autonomy of non-Russian minorities within the empire. The two Russification campaigns evoked widespread Finnish resistance, starting with petitions and escalating to strikes, passive resistance (including draft resistance) and eventually active resistance. Finnish opposition to Russification was one of the main factors that ultimately led to Finland's declaration of independence in 1917. ","Finland | official language | Finnish

Her brother, having lost a singing contest to the storied Vinminen, promised Aino's "" hands and feet "" in marriage if Vinminen would save him from drowning in the swamp into which Joukahainen had been thrown. Aino's mother was pleased at the idea of marrying her daughter to such a famous and well born person, but Aino did not want to marry such an old man. Rather than submit to this fate, Aino drowned herself (or ended up as a nix). However, she returned to taunt the grieving Vinminen as a salmon. The name Aino, meaning "" the only one "", was invented by Elias Lnnrot who composed the Kalevala. In the original poems she was mentioned as "" the only daughter "" (aino tytti).

362,Beyond Good &amp; Evil (video game),"Beyond Good & Evil is a 2003 action-adventure video game developed and published by Ubisoft for the PlayStation 2, Microsoft Windows, Xbox and GameCube platforms. The story follows the adventures of Jade, an investigative reporter and martial artist, who works with a resistance movement to reveal a planet-wide alien conspiracy. The player controls Jade and allies, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, and obtaining photographic evidence. Michel Ancel, creator of the Rayman series, envisioned the game as the first part of a trilogy. The game was developed under the codename "" Project BG&E ; "" by 30 Ubisoft Pictures employees with production lasting more than three years. One of the main goals of the game is to create a meaningful story while giving players lots of freedom, though the game adopts a relatively linear structure. The game was received poorly when it was shown at E3 2002, and it prompted the developers to change some of the game's elements, including Jade's design. Ancel also attempted to streamline the game in order to make the game more commercially appealing. Beyond Good & Evil was critically acclaimed. Critics praised the game's animation, setting, story, and design, but criticized the game's combat and technical issues. The game received a nomination for "" Game of the Year "" at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards. While the game had a cult following, it was considered a commercial failure at launch. A full HD re-mastered version of the game was released on Xbox Live Arcade in March 2011 and on PlayStation Network in June 2011. A prequel, Beyond Good and Evil 2, is in development and was announced at E3 2017. ","Project BG&E | platform | PlayStation 2

364,Fyodor Kulakov,"Fyodor Davydovich Kulakov () (4 February 1918  17 July 1978) was a Soviet-Russian statesman during the Cold War. Kulakov served as Stavropol First Secretary from 1960 until 1964, immediately following Nikita Khrushchev's ouster. During his First Secretaryship in Stavropol, Kulakov met Mikhail Gorbachev ; Kulakov became Gorbachev's mentor, and when he left his Stavropol First Secretaryship to enter national politics, Gorbachev took over his former office. Kulakov was elected to several important seats in the 1960s. In 1971, he was elected to the Political Bureau (Politburo). He became a leading figure of Soviet leadership, and impressed Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to such an extent that Western commentators believed that Kulakov would become Brezhnev's successor. This did not happen since Kulakov died in 1978, four years before Brezhnev. ","Mikhail Gorbachev | country of citizenship | Soviet - Russian

365,Guido Bonatti,"Guido Bonatti (died between 1296 and 1300) was an Italian mathematician, astronomer and astrologer, who was the most celebrated astrologer of the 13th century. Bonatti was advisor of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, Ezzelino da Romano III, Guido Novello da Polenta and Guido I da Montefeltro. He also served the communal governments of Florence, Siena and Forl. His employers were all Ghibellines (supporters of the Holy Roman Emperor), who were in conflict with the Guelphs (supporters of the Pope), and all were excommunicated at some time or another. Bonatti's astrological reputation was also criticised in Dante's Divine Comedy, where he is depicted as residing in hell as punishment for his astrology. His most famous work was his Liber Astronomiae or ' Book of Astronomy ', written around 1277. This remained a classic astrology textbook for two centuries. ","Guido Bonatti | date of death | 1296

370,Great Belt Fixed Link,"The Great Belt Fixed link () is a multi-element fixed link crossing the Great Belt strait between the Danish islands of Zealand and Funen. It consists of five structures : a road suspension bridge and a railway tunnel between Zealand and the small island Sprog located in the middle of the Great Belt, and a box girder bridge for both road and rail traffic between Sprog and Funen. The "" Great Belt Bridge "" (Danish : Storebltsbroen) commonly refers to the suspension bridge, although it may also be used to mean the box-girder bridge or the link in its entirety. The suspension bridge, officially known as the East Bridge, has the world's third longest main span (1.6  km), and the longest outside of Asia. It was designed by the Danish engineering firms COWI and Ramboll. The link replaced the ferry service that had been the primary means of crossing the Great Belt. After more than five decades of speculation and debate, the decision to construct the link was made in 1986 ; the original intent was to complete the railway link three years before opening the road connection, but the link opened to rail traffic in 1997 and road traffic in 1998. At an estimated cost of DKK 21.4 billion (1988 prices), the link is the largest construction project in Danish history. The link has reduced travel times significantly ; previously taking about an hour by ferry, the Great Belt can now be crossed in about ten minutes. The construction of the link and the resund Bridge (constr. 1995-1999) have together enabled driving from mainland Europe to Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia through Denmark. Operation and maintenance are performed by A / S Storeblt under Sund & Blt. Construction and maintenance are financed by tolls on vehicles and trains. Cyclists are not permitted to use the bridge, but cycles may be transported by train or bus. ","Storebæltsbroen | country | Denmark

371,Book of Royal Degrees,"The Book of Degrees of the Royal Genealogy ( ) was the first official work of historiography produced in the nascent Tsardom of Russia. It was commissioned by Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow from Ivan the Terrible's personal confessor, Andrew, in 1560. This vast work of codification recast historical data compiled from medieval Russian chronicles so as to suit Ivan's tastes and ambitions in the wake of his coronation as the first Russian Czar. The book gave shape to the idea of Moscow being the "" Third Rome "" by tracing Ivan's patrilineal descent not only from Rurik but from the first Roman emperor, Augustus. This fantasy genealogy was borrowed from the earlier Tale of the Princes of Vladimir. The compilation is subdivided into 17 parts, or degrees (hence the title). Each degree corresponds to a generation of Ivan's royal ancestors. According to Arthur Voice, the book "" glorifies to the utmost the historic past and the present of Muscovite Rus ', primarily by extolling the rulers as having acted in full accord with the church "". The biographies of Kievan, Vladimir-Suzdal and Muscovite rulers tend to pass over into hagiography. Each monarch is presented as a saint, and his actions are cast as "" holy deeds "". The political philosophy of the time tends to be obscured by thick layers of bombast and rhetoric. ","Moscow | country | Russian

The obelisks in London and New York are a pair ; the one in Paris is also part of a pair originally from a different site in Luxor, where its twin remains. Although all three needles are genuine Ancient Egyptian obelisks, their shared nickname is a misnomer, as they have no connection with the Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and were already over a thousand years old in her lifetime. The London and New York needles were originally made during the reign of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Thutmose III. The Paris needle dates to the reign of the 19th Dynasty Pharaoh Ramesses II, and was the first to be moved and re-erected. The New York needle was the first to acquire the French nickname, "" L'aiguille de Cloptre "", when it stood in Alexandria. ","Luxor | country | Egypt

377,Fingerpori,"Fingerpori is a Finnish comic strip written and drawn by Pertti Jarla. It started in Helsingin Sanomat in February 2007, and is currently syndicated in Satakunnan Kansa, Aamulehti, Karjalainen, Keskisuomalainen, Turun Sanomat and Etel-Saimaa. Several strip collections in album format have also been published. The main setting of the strip is Fingerpori, an imaginary Finnish small town. The main character in the strip is the eyeglass-wearing Heimo Vesa, but other citizens also appear, such as the brash-mouthed caf worker Rivo-Riitta. As well as the Fingerpori residents, the strip has included characters such as the Pope, The Phantom, Spider-Man, Adolf Hitler, Kimi Rikknen and Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. A few strips, featuring Jesus, have caused controversy in some circles. The humour in Fingerpori is largely verbal and is often based on (mostly untranslatable) wordplay and puns. For instance, Vesa works at the multidisciplinary research center Fingerpoli, where "" girls with pigtails "" is a result of a bungled stem cell experiment. Jokes are often also based on allusions, such as recurrent jokes about the skull ring of The Phantom. Besides this, the strips often have an absurdist element. According to Jarla, his original vision for Fingerpori was to create a milieu of an "" East German Duckburg "", but the current Fingerpori is more like a Finnish town still stuck to the 1970s as in Aki Kaurismki's films. Although Fingerpori contains some political satire, the author claims it is not a political comic strip. ","Heimo Vesa | creator | Pertti Jarla

The river and its associated catchments lie within the bounds of the Rimutaka Forest Park, which is administered by the Department of Conservation. Orongorongo River is the main artery of the Rimutaka Range, draining an area with rainfall of up to a year, which is twice as much as the rainfall at the mouth of the river at Cook Strait. For much of its course the river is a braided river, with a wide bed of greywacke shingle and gravel and a number of streams of water. The gravel bed can be seen as light-coloured areas of varying width in the adjacent image. Because the rainfall in the Rimutaka Range often comes in high-intensity rainstorms, the river is prone to violent floods. The most severe of these floods sweep away most of the river's vegetated islands every 15 to 20 years. Between these floods, the shingle islands are gradually colonised by various low growing plants, followed by a host of native shrubs such as tauhinu and manuka, and eventually small trees.

387,Charles S. Johnson,"Charles Spurgeon Johnson (July 24, 1893  October 27, 1956) was an American sociologist and college administrator, the first black president of historically black Fisk University, and a lifelong advocate for racial equality and the advancement of civil rights for African Americans and all ethnic minorities. He preferred to work collaboratively with liberal white groups in the South, quietly as a "" sideline activist, "" to get practical results. His position is often contrasted with that of W. E. B. Du Bois, who was a powerful and militant advocate for blacks and described Johnson as "" too conservative. "" During Johnson's academic studies and leadership of Fisk University during the 1930s and 1940s, the South had legal racial segregation and Jim Crow discriminatory laws and practices, including having disfranchised most black voters in constitutions passed at the turn of the century. Johnson was unwavering in personal terms in his opposition to this oppressive system, yet worked hard to change race relations in terms of short-term practical gains. His grandson Jeh Johnson served as the United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2013 to 2017. ","Charles Spurgeon Johnson | employer | Fisk University

389,Faliero coup,"The Faliero Coup was a failed 1355 coup designed to overthrow Venice's established republican government. Strains between the Venetian commoners and the nobility, originally stemming from the catastrophic failure of the nobility in the Battle of Porto-Longo against Venice's long-time rival, Genoa, are largely considered to be the main cause for the coup. However, traditional stories also point to the marriage of Doge Marino Faliero as a possible cause for the coup. Faliero, an 81 year old man, had recently taken a young bride, who was rumored to be engaged in multiple affairs, including with Michele Steno, a Venetian statesman and future Doge. The consistent rumors and apparent intense arrogance of the established Venetian elite seems to have gotten to Faliero in this explanation for a coup. A more reasonable one, however, is that Faliero wished to transform Venice into a dictatorship, mirroring those of Genoa and other northern Italian city-states. This view is, however, disputed by some historians, who cite Faliero's apparent regret at his trial, and, his lack of mentioning his belief that a dictatorship would better suit Venice's interests, a valid argument. These two actions are much more consistent with a man regretting a passionate crime, than one who had executed a calculated plan, some argue. The coup was poorly organized and abortive. Faliero convened with two popular, wealthy, public figures who also had quarlles with the noblility : Bertuccio Isarello and Filippo Calendario. After convincing them of the need for a coup, he laid out his plan : Faliero and Isarello would recruit 20 trusted men who would assist in the overthrow of the government, who would each in turn recruit 40 each. However, due to the incredible variability of any given individuals ' reaction to the plan, rumors of unrest quickly began to spread throughout the city and, the Venetian people, fearing the civil turmoil which was swelling up all around them in northern Italy and Byzantium, reported the rumors to the authorities. One of the most powerful governmental bodies of Republican Venice, the Council of Ten, soon convened to discuss the rumors. They became concerned about the Doge's role in the plot and, exercising emergency powers, together with the Doge's councillors, the Signori di Notte, and the six sestieri, ordered the immediate and unquestioned arrest of Calendario and Isarello, who, upon questioning, implicated the Doge. After a series of quick albeit somber trials, the conspirators were imprisoned and executed, including Calendario, Isarello, and Doge Faliero. ","Battle of Porto-Longo | location | Venice

390,Drake Landing Solar Community,"The Drake Landing Solar Community (DLSC) is a planned community in Okotoks, Alberta, Canada, equipped with a central solar heating system and other energy efficient technology. This heating system is the first of its kind in North America, although much larger systems have been built in northern Europe. The 52 homes in the community are heated with a solar district heating system that is charged with heat originating from solar collectors on the garage roofs and is enabled for year-round heating by underground seasonal thermal energy storage (STES). The system was designed to model a way of addressing global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. The solar energy is captured by 800 solar thermal collectors located on the roofs of all 52 houses ' garages. It is billed as the first solar powered subdivision in North America, although its electricity and transportation needs are provided by conventional sources. In 2012 the installation achieved a world record solar fraction of 97 % ; that is, providing that amount of the community's heating requirements with solar energy over a one-year time span.

391,Elwood Buchanan,"Elwood C. Buchanan, Sr was an American jazz trumpeter and teacher who became an early mentor of Miles Davis. Buchanan was born in St Louis, Missouri on January 26, 1907, and was trained in music by Joseph Gustat, the principal trumpeter with the St Louis Symphony Orchestra. He began his career playing in local dance bands, including Andy Kirk's orchestra, and on the riverboats that travelled on the Mississippi River between St Louis and New Orleans. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, he taught music and directed the band at Lincoln High School in East St Louis, and also visited the local elementary schools to give weekly lessons. Buchanan was known for his strict and demanding teaching style, and for encouraging pupils to compete with one another. Buchanan was a patient of Miles Davis's father, who told him of his son's interest in music. Although Davis, at thirteen, was then too young to attend Buchanan's school, Buchanan began giving him private lessons. Davis joined the school band when he began attending Lincoln. Although Buchanan had the band play mainly marches rather than jazz, the techniques he taught profoundly affected Davis ' jazz style. In particular, Buchanan went against the times by recommending to his students that they play without vibrato, and is said to have broken Davis of the habit by rapping his knuckles with a ruler and commanding : "" Stop shakin ' that note. You 're going to shake enough when you get old "". Buchanan also encouraged Davis to study the lean, relaxed playing of Bobby Hackett (then little known beyond the East Coast) and Harold Shorty Baker. In this, too, Buchanan went against fashion ; the most popular trumpeter of the day was Louis Armstrong, whose hot playing style was very different from those of Hackett or Baker. Davis later credited Buchanan with persuading his parents to buy him a new trumpet, rather than a violin as his mother had preferred. Buchanan also introduced Davis to Clark Terry, who would become his recording partner. In his autobiography, Davis recalled : "" Mr. Buchanan was the biggest influence on my life up until then. He was definitely the person who took me all the way into music at that time. "" ","Elwood C. Buchanan | place of birth | St Louis

392,How Could Hell Be Any Worse?,"How Could Hell Be Any Worse ? is the first full-length album by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released on January 19, 1982 by Epitaph Records. Released almost a year after their self-titled EP, it was financed by a $ 3,000 loan by guitarist Brett Gurewitz's father. Its success surprised the band when it sold 10,000 copies in under a year. How Could Hell Be Any Worse ? was recorded over two time periods at Track Record Studios in North Hollywood, California, during October  November 1980 and again in January 1981. After the original recording sessions, drummer Jay Ziskrout left Bad Religion and was replaced by his friend and the band's roadie Pete Finestone, who was brought in to complete the rest of the album. Though not yet credited as a member of the band, future guitarist Greg Hetson, who was in Circle Jerks during this time, provided a guitar solo on "" Part III "". How Could Hell Be Any Worse ? was also Bad Religion's last album featuring Jay Bentley on bass for six years, until 1988's Suffer.

393,Souvlaki,"Souvlaki (Greek :), plural souvlakia, is a popular Greek fast food consisting of small pieces of meat and sometimes vegetables grilled on a skewer. It is usually eaten straight off the skewer while still hot. It can be served with pita bread, fried potatoes, lemon, and sauces, but the souvlaki itself is eaten on its own, with the side dishes eaten subsequently. The meat usually used in Greece and Cyprus is pork, although chicken, beef, and lamb may also be used. In other countries (and for tourists), souvlaki may be made with meats such as lamb, beef, chicken, and sometimes fish. The word souvlaki is a diminutive of the Medieval Greek  souvla ' skewer ', itself borrowed from Latin subula. ' Souvlaki ' is the common term in Hellenic Macedonia and other regions of northern Greece, while in southern Greece around Athens it is commonly known as ' kalamaki ', ' reed '.

The memo was delivered in May 2011 ; Mansoor Ijaz wrote a Financial Times article in October 2011 bringing initial public attention to the affair. The memo, which at first was questioned to even exist, was published in November, leading to the resignation of Ambassador Haqqani and the continuing Pakistani Supreme Court investigation. Central actors in the plot include Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz, who alleged that long-time friend and former Pakistan Ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani asked him to deliver a confidential memo asking for US assistance. The memo is alleged to have been drafted by Haqqani at the behest of President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari. The memo was delivered to Mike Mullen through then National Security Advisor James L. Jones. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has opened a broader inquiry into the origins, credibility and purpose of the memo. On 19 April 2012 a petition was submitted in the Supreme Court to arrest former Pakistan ambassador to US Husain Haqqani through Interpol for his refusal to return to Pakistan. On 12 June the supreme court commission released its findings and found that after testimony by all parties and verifying the forensic results of Ijaz's BlackBerry conversations with Haqqani it was "" incontrovertibly established "" that Husain Haqqani had written the memo and was being called back to Pakistan to face likely charges of treason.

Built in the 1720s, the palace offers a mixture of rococo, Gustavian and Victorian styles. The interior design is regarded as one of Sweden's finest. Tullgarn Palace is mainly associated with King Gustaf V and Queen Victoria, who spent their summers here at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century. However, the palace was originally built for Duke Fredrik Adolf in the 1770s. Since Tullgarn was a popular summer palace amongst Swedish royalty, the palace houses fine examples of interiors from different epochs and personal styles, such as the small drawing room, decorated in the 1790s, the breakfast room in southern German Renaissance style from the 1890s and Gustav V's cigar room, which has remained largely untouched since his death in 1950.

398,First Battle of Homs,"The first Battle of Homs was fought on December 10, 1260, between the Ilkhanates of Persia and the forces of Egypt, in Syria. After the historic Mamluk victory over the Ilkhanates at the Battle of Ain Jalut in September 1260, Hulagu Khan of the Ilkhanate had the Ayyubid Sultan of Damascus and other Ayyubid princes executed in revenge, thus effectively ending the dynasty in Syria. However, the defeat at Ain Jalut forced the Ilkhanate armies out of Syria and the Levant. The main cities of Syria, Aleppo and Damascus were thus left open to Mamluk occupation. But Homs and Hama remained in the possession of minor Ayyubid princes. These princes, rather than the Mamluks of Cairo themselves, actually fought and won the First Battle of Homs. Due to the open war between Hulagu and his cousin Berke of the Golden Horde during the civil war of the Mongol Empire, the Ilkhanate could only afford to send 6,000 troops back into Syria to retake control of the lands. This expedition was initiated by Ilkhanate generals such as Baidu who was forced to leave Gaza when the Mamluks advanced just before the battle of Ain Jalut. After quickly recapturing Aleppo, the force travelled southwards to Homs, but were decisively defeated. This ended the first campaign into Syria by the Ilkhanate, though there were several later incursions, none of which ended with conquests lasting more than a year. ","Homs | country | Syria

399,List of Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh,"The Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh is the chief executive of the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. In accordance with the Constitution of India, the governor is a state's de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly, the state's governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no term limits. Following Madhya Pradesh's reorganisation on 1 November 1956, 17 people have served as its chief minister. Eleven of these belonged to the Indian National Congress, including the inaugural officeholder Ravishankar Shukla. The first non-Congress chief minister was Govind Narayan Singh who defected from the party and lead a Samyukta Vidhayak Dal government from 1967 to 1969. Digvijaya Singh of the Congress became the first officeholder to serve two full five-year terms. He was succeeded by Uma Bharti of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Madhya Pradesh's only woman chief minister. Her party-mate Shivraj Singh Chouhan is the current incumbent and the state's longest-serving chief minister, having held office since November 2005.

The plot also survives in form of a Persian language story, which appears to be a adaptation of the play, and is included in the 11th century text Majmal-ut-Tawarikh. In the play, king Ramagupta decides to surrender his queen Dhruvadevi ("" Devi "") to a Shaka enemy when besieged. Ramagupta's younger brother Chandragupta enters the enemy camp disguised as the queen, and kills the enemy ruler. The rest of the story is not clear from the surviving passages, but based on other historical evidence, it appears that in the last part of the play, Chandragupta dethrones Ramagupta and marries Dhruvadevi.

402,Kiirunavaara,"Kiirunavaara (Northern Sami : Gironvrri, Menkieli : Kierunavaara) is a mountain in Kiruna, Sweden that contains one of the largest and richest bodies of iron ore in the world. The presence of iron in the area was known already in the mid-17th century, but at this early time communication lines to this northerly region were quite insufficient to permit any major exploitation. Only with the construction of a railway, the Iron Ore Line and the ports of Narvik and Lule at the end of the 19th century did commercial mining become a realistic proposition. The Swedish mining company LKAB (Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag) has been mining the mountain since the beginning of the 20th century. The mining area around Kiruna and Malmberget and the iron port and steelworks at Lule made Norrbotten County one of the first, and most prominent, regions of heavy industry in Sweden, and the wider region has remained at the forefront of mining and steel smelting and alloying technology.

403,Guybrush Threepwood,"Guybrush Ulysses Threepwood is the main protagonist of the Monkey Island series of computer adventure games by LucasArts. Guybrush is voiced by actor Dominic Armato in the third, fourth and fifth games, as well as the enhanced remakes of The Secret of Monkey Island and. Though a "" mighty pirate "" by his own account, it is a running joke throughout the games for characters to garble Guybrush Threepwood's unusual name, either deliberately or accidentally. The origin of the name "" Guybrush "" comes in part from Deluxe Paint, the tool used by the artists to create the character sprite. Since the character had no name at this point, the file was simply called ' Guy '. When the file was saved, Steve Purcell, the artist responsible for the sprite, added ' brush ' to the filename, indicating that it was the Deluxe Paint "" brush file "" for the "" Guy "" sprite. The file name was then "" guybrush.bbm "", so the developers eventually just started referring to this unnamed ' Guy ' as "" Guybrush "". Guybrush's surname "" Threepwood "" was decided upon in a company contest and is derived from P. G. Wodehouse's family of characters including Galahad Threepwood and Freddie Threepwood (with whom he shares similar characteristics). "" Threepwood "" is also rumoured to have been the name of Dave Grossman's RPG character. ","Monkey Island | developer | LucasArts

The treasury was well aware of the difference in tax takes, and the incentive to convert ; the legal reforms of Bayezid II halved some criminal penalties on nonmuslim taxpayers "" so that the taxpayers shall not vanish "" ; this rule was reconfimed, a century later, in 1587. In other cases, local taxes were imposed on nonmuslims specifically to encourage conversion. spene had existed in the Balkans before the Ottoman conquest ; the Ottoman Empire typically adapted local taxes and institutions in each conquered area, leading to a patchwork of different taxes and rates. The concept of spene, theoretically a payment in lieu of corvee labour, was derived from the Byzantine "" zeugaratikion "", a land tax based on the zeugarion-the area of farmland which could be ploughed by a pair of oxen. The zeugarion itself was taken up as the Ottoman "" ift "", a word meaning "" pair "". ","Ottoman | country | Ottoman Empire

406,Cello Suites (Bach),"The six Cello Suites, BWV 1007-1012, are suites for unaccompanied cello by Johann Sebastian Bach. They are some of the most frequently performed and recognizable solo compositions ever written for cello. Bach most likely composed them during the period 1717  23, when he served as Kapellmeister in Kthen. The title given on the cover of the Anna Magdalena Bach manuscript was Suites  Violoncello Solo senza Basso (Suites for cello solo without bass). These suites for unaccompanied cello are remarkable in that they achieve the effect of implied three- to four-voice contrapuntal and polyphonic music in a single musical line. As usual in a Baroque musical suite, after the prelude which begins each suite, all the other movements are based around baroque dance types ; the cello suites are structured in six movements each : prelude, allemande, courante, sarabande, two minuets or two bourres or two gavottes, and a final gigue. The Bach cello suites are considered to be among the most profound of all classical music works. Wilfrid Mellers described them in 1980 as "" Monophonic music wherein a man has created a dance of God. "" Due to the works ' technical demands, tude-like nature, and difficulty in interpretation because of the non-annotated nature of the surviving copies, the cello suites were little known and rarely publicly performed until they were revived and recorded by Pablo Casals in the early 20th century. They have since been performed and recorded by many renowned cellists and have been transcribed for numerous other instruments ; they are considered some of Bach's greatest musical achievements.

Law in the Cayman Islands tends to be a combination of the very old and the very new. As a leading offshore financial centre, the Cayman Islands has extremely modern statutes dealing with company law, insolvency, banking law, trust law, insurance and other related matters. However, in other areas of law, such as family law, the laws of the Cayman Islands are based upon old English statutes which can cause some difficulty in modern times. Other areas of law, such as international law, are essentially regulated externally through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London by Order in Council. A large body of the laws of the Cayman Islands consists of the common law, which continually updates itself through judicial precedent in the Territory and in other common law countries. The Cayman Islands is a dependent territory of the United Kingdom.

Until 2001 a Romanian Air Force military helicopters unit was located at the nearby airfield. In 2007, as the airfield was not used by the Romanian Air Force anylonger, the former Minister of Transport Radu Berceanu suggested to use the location for Bucharest's new low-cost flights airport(as the operational tariffs for Bucharest's previous low-cost hub, Aurel Vlaicu Airport, were set to grow). However, some analysts considered the project unrealistic and doomed to fail due to the poor conditions of the infrastructure in the area. Eventually those plans were abandoned and all low-cost flights were moved in March 2012 at Bucharest main airport Henri Coand International Airport.

410,Irish in the British Armed Forces,"The Irish in the British Armed Forces refers to the history of Irish people serving in the British Armed Forces (including the British Army, the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and other elements). Ireland was then as part of the United Kingdom from 1800-1922 and during this time in particular many Irishmen fought in the British Army. Different social classes joined the military for various reasons, including the Anglo-Irish officers who thoroughly identified with the British Empire, while others, typically poorer Irish Catholics did so to feed their families or seeking adventure. Many Irishmen and members of the Irish diaspora in Britain and also Ulster-Scots served in both World War I and World War II as part of the British forces. However, especially since the advent of Irish independence and The Troubles, the topic of enlistment in the British forces has been controversial for the Irish at home, but does still occur. Since partition, Irish citizens have continued to have the right to serve in the British Army. Since 2007, when troops finally withdrew from the streets of Northern Ireland, the number of Irish citizens joining has increased, reaching its highest levels since World War II.

411,Battle of Samugarh,"Battle of Samugarh, Jang-e-Samugarh, (May 29, 1658), was a decisive battle in the struggle for the throne during the Mughal war of succession (1658  1659) between the sons of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan after the emperor's serious illness in September 1657. The battle of Samugarh was fought between his sons Dara Shikoh (the eldest son and heir apparent) and his two younger brothers Aurangzeb and Murad Baksh (third and fourth sons of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan). Dara Shikoh began to retreat towards Samugarh, about 10 miles (16  km) east of Agra, India, south of the Yamuna River, after Aurangzeb had defeated Dara Shikoh's forces during the Battle of Dharmat. Aurangzeb and his smaller but formidable army then flanked Dara s fortified line along the Chambal River by finding a little-known and unguarded ford. The battle was fought during northern India's warmest season and Aurangzeb's men were on the march for a very long while. The army of Aurangzeb arrived with yellow banners and flags and fortified their position in front of the heir apparent. Dara Shikoh then tried to protect his rear flank by erecting massive red tents and banners. ","Dara Shikoh | sibling | Murad Baksh

The song was performed twelfth on the night, following Germany's Maxi & Chris Garden with "" Lied fr einen Freund "" and preceding Denmark's Kirsten & Sren with "" Ka ' du se hva ' jeg sa ' ? "". At the close of voting, it had received no points, placing it last out of a field of 21. The song is a ballad in which the singer likens the object of his affection to the Mona Lisa, in that she is very mysterious but nonetheless entrancing. The song was recorded in German, French and English. Due to the song's poor performance, the English version was not released. It was succeeded as Austrian representative at the 1989 Contest by Thomas Forstner singing "" Nur ein Lied "". ","Germany | official language | German

It is said that this mourning and sadness gave this place its name  Penedo da Saudade (Rock of Nostalgia). Many centuries later, it seemed to be the right place for the romantic encounters of students, and it was at this time that Coimbra Fado was born, challenging eternity with words they etched on the stone.

415,Osaka Bay,"Osaka Bay ( saka-wan) is a bay in western Japan. As an eastern part of the Inland Sea, it is separated from the Pacific Ocean by the Kii Channel and from the neighbor western part of the Inland Sea by the Akashi Strait. Its western shore is formed by Awaji Island, and its northern and eastern shores are part of the Kansai metropolitan area. Major ports on Osaka Bay include Osaka, Kobe, Nishinomiya, Sakai, Amagasaki, and Hannan. A number of artificial islands have been created in Osaka Bay in past decades, including Kansai International Airport, Kobe Airport, Port Island, and Rokko Island. Several islands at the south end of Osaka Bay are part of the Seto Inland Sea National Park. Industries locate around Osaka Bay because there is a skilled and plentiful workforce, many port facilities, efficient linkages (from small to medium to large firms). There are good transport links (including the Shinkansen), room for expansion (land reclaimed from the sea), and a large local market (9 million). In a recent economic change in Osaka Bay, older ' heavy ' industries such as Nippon Steel have declined, and ' new tech ' companies such as ICT have expanded. There has been a growth in the quaternary industries  research, development, and information. There has also been a development in the science parks and the building of new motorways ; this has meant the loss of the countryside. The Tempozan Ferris Wheel and Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan are both located in the Tempozan Harbor Village area of Osaka. ","Japan | located in or next to body of water | Inland Sea

These restoration plans by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission include the planned modification of a Pacific Gas and Electric pipeline that has blocked fish migration in Alameda Creek. The Sunol Valley Rock Quarry is located within the Sunol Valley ; this facility has been used as the source for fill material in a considerable amount of the land development for neighboring communities. In the course of excavating this quarry for such fill, chemical analysis has been conducted to ascertain the safety of such soils. Resultant analyses have shown that the soil has environmentally safe characteristics as defined by low or non-detectable concentrations of 18 heavy metals and asbestos fibers.

420,Historiographic metafiction,"Historiographic metafiction is a term coined by Canadian literary theorist Linda Hutcheon in the late 1980s. The term is used for works of fiction which combine the literary devices of metafiction with historical fiction. Works regarded as historiographic metafiction are also distinguished by frequent allusions to other artistic, historical and literary texts (i.e. intertextuality) in order to show the extent to which works of both literature and historiography are dependent on the history of discourse. The term is closely associated with works of postmodern literature, usually novels. According to Hutcheon, in "" A Poetics of Postmodernism "", works of historiographic metafiction are "" those well-known and popular novels which are both intensely self-reflexive and yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages "". Works often described as examples of historiographical metafiction include : William Shakespeare's Pericles, Prince of Tyre (c.1608), John Fowles ' The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969), E. L. Doctorow's Ragtime (1975), William Kennedy's Legs (1975), Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (1981), A. S. Byatt's Possession (1990), Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient (1992), Thomas Pynchon's Mason & Dixon (1997) and many others. By seeking to represent both actual historical events from World War Two while, at the same time, problematizing the very notion of doing exactly that, Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five (1969) features a metafictional, "" Janus-headed "" perspective.

421,TY.O,"TY.O is the third studio album by British record producer and recording artist Taio Cruz. Taking a more electronic music sound than his previous releases, TY.O was released in December 2011 by Universal Island Records but for reasons unknown to Cruz, its British and American release were held off. Instead, a year after its original release, an extended play (EP) version of the album titled The Fast Hits was released in the UK on 16 December 2012. TY.O features a range of top-twenty and top-thirty singles including "" Hangover "" (featuring Flo Rida), "" Troublemaker "", "" There She Goes "" (sometimes featuring Pitbull), the limited release "" World in Our Hands "" and "" Fast Car "" which features on the Special Edition and Fast Hits versions of the album. The album itself reached top-twenty in Switzerland and top-thirty in Germany, considerably less successful than Cruz's previous albums. ","Taio Cruz | record label | Universal Island Records

422,Aramis Ayala,"Aramis Ayala (born February 2, 1975) is the State Attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida. Ayala was elected in November 2016, and serves as the chief prosecutor. Ayala was born in Saginaw, Michigan, and graduated from the University of Michigan with an undergraduate degree. She then obtained her law degree from the University of Detroit. Controversy arose after she announced she would not seek capital punishment in any case, causing Governor Rick Scott to reassign potential death penalty cases to another State Attorney. Ayala has filed lawsuits disputing this action in the Supreme Court of Florida, and in federal court. Ayala lost her Supreme Court case against Gov Rick Scott. The Florida Supreme Court ruled against Ayala saying the Governor was within his power to take cases away from Ayala because of her position to abandon the death penalty.

It was based at Australia House and its aims and objectives were to present new Australian plays around London's Fringe featuring professional Australian actors then living in London. The inaugural Production Coordinator was Barbara Angell and a fund-raising concert was held in the Australia House basement on Sunday, 25 January 1976, coinciding with the Australia Day Weekend. Monies raised supported the group during its lifetime. Members included Ken Shorter, Darlene Johnson, Bob Hornery, Mark McManus. Playwrights who were premiered in London included Steve J. Spears. The Association continued for about 2 years, presenting at such as The Arts Theatre, The Gate and various pub rooms until security measures during the IRA bombing campaign inhibited audience attendances.

424,List of Spanish inventions and discoveries,"The following list is composed of items, techniques and processes that were invented by or discovered by people from Spain. Spain was an important center of knowledge during the medieval era. While most of western and southern Europe suffered from the collapse of the Roman Empire, although declining, some regions of the former empire, Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula), southern Italy, and the remainder of the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire, did not to suffer from the full impact of the so-called Dark Ages when education collapsed with the collapse of the empire and most knowledge was lost. The Islamic conquests of places such as Egypt, which was a major part of the Byzantine Empire, and other places which were centers of knowledge in earlier times, gave the Muslims access to knowledge from many cultures which they translated into Arabic and recorded in books for the use of their own educated elites, who flourished in this period, and took with them to the Hispania after it fell under Muslim control. Much of this knowledge was later translated by Christian and Jewish scholars in the Christian kingdoms of the Reconquista from Arabic into Latin, and from there it spread through Europe.

425,Glandularia,"Glandularia, common name mock vervain or mock verbena, is a genus of annual and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the family Verbenaceae. They are native to the Americas. Glandularia species are closely related to the true vervains and sometimes still included with them in Verbena. Horizontal chloroplast transfer occurred at least twice and possibly three times between these genera, which are otherwise too distinct to warrant unification. The discovery of the signal in the chloroplast genome was announced in 2008 by researchers from the University of Washington. Somehow, chloroplasts from V.  orcuttiana, swamp verbena (V.  hastata) or a close relative of these had admixed into the G.  bipinnatifida genome. Although hybridization runs rampant in the true and mock vervains  the ancestors of the well-known garden vervain are quite obscure  it does not seem to have been the cause of the cross-species gene transfer. In addition, the researchers discovered the signal of one more transfer event. This had introduced chloroplasts from an ancestral member of the Verbena lineage nowadays found in South America into Glandularia. Although all members of the present genus can be distinguished to have a chromosome count of five, the South American species are diploid, while polyploid hybrid Glandularia are very widespread from northern Central America northwards. The second genetic introgression must have occurred before the genus spread north, as species with the Verbena-like chloroplasts are found all over the Americas. Since the new chloroplast genes replaced the old ones, it may be that the possibly hybridogenic G.  bipinnatifida actually underwent horizontal chloroplast transfer twice in its evolutionary history.

426,Admission to the Union,"The Admission to the Union Clause of the United States Constitution, oftentimes called the New States Clause, and found at Article IV, Section 3,, authorizes the Congress to admit new states into the United States beyond the thirteen already in existence at the time the Constitution went into effect. The Constitution went into effect on June 21, 1788, after ratification by 9 of the 13 states, and the federal government began operations under it on March 4, 1789. Since then, 37 additional states have been admitted into the Union. Each new state has been admitted on an equal footing with those already in existence. Of the 37 states admitted to the Union by Congress, all but six have been established within an existing U.S. organized incorporated territory. A state so created might encompass all or a portion of a territory. When the people of a territory or a region thereof would make their desire for statehood known to the federal government, in most cases Congress passed an enabling act authorizing the people of that territory or region to frame a proposed state constitution as a step toward admission to the Union. Although the use of an enabling act was a common historic practice, a number of states were admitted to the Union without one. In many instances, an enabling act would detail the mechanism by which the territory would be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers. Although the use of such an act is a traditional historic practice, a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted. The broad outline for this process was established by the Land Ordinance of 1784 and the 1787 Northwest Ordinance, both of which predate the present U.S. Constitution. The Admission to the Union Clause also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress. The primary intent of this caveat was to give Eastern states that still had western land claims (there were four at that time) a veto over whether their western counties could become states. This clause has served the same function since, each time a proposal to partition an existing state or states has arisen. ","Congress | applies to jurisdiction | U.S.

It had only male members until 1727, when Sophia Schrder and Judith Fischer were employed as vocalists ; in the 1850s, the harpist Marie Pauline hman became the first female instrumentalist. It had a golden age under the leadership of several members of the Dben family during the 17th century. In the 18th century, its directors included Johan Helmich Roman and Francesco Uttini. From 1731, public concerts were performed at Riddarhuset in Stockholm.

429,Queen of Mauritius,"Elizabeth II was Queen of Mauritius from 1968 to 1992. Mauritius was a constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth as head of state. The Queen was also the monarch of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms. Her constitutional roles in Mauritius were delegated to a Governor-General. The Parliament of the United Kingdom's Mauritius Independence Act 1968 transformed the British Crown Colony of Mauritius into an independent sovereign state. Unusually, no member of the British royal family attended the independence ceremony on the island because of security concerns. Princess Alexandra was due to attend but after communal violence the British Minister of State for the Commonwealth, Lord Shepherd, advised that her visit be cancelled. The Queen and her husband Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, visited Mauritius for three days (2426 March) in 1972, as part of a tour of Asia and Africa. They arrived in Port Louis on the royal yacht Britannia after visiting the Seychelles. They were met by a crowd of nearly a quarter of a million people, and rode through the city in an open-topped car. During the visit, the Queen opened the sixth session of the third Mauritius Parliament. The royal couple left Mauritius for Nairobi by air. It was the first ever visit to the island by a reigning monarch. Mauritius became a republic within the Commonwealth in 1992 with the President of Mauritius replacing the Queen as head of state. To date, Mauritius is the most recent of the Queen's realms to become a republic. ","Elizabeth II | country of citizenship | United Kingdom

430,Stars and Stripes Forever (film),"Stars and Stripes Forever is a 1952 American Technicolor film biography of the late-19th-/early-20th-century composer and band leader John Philip Sousa. This 20th Century Fox feature was produced by Lamar Trotti, directed by Henry Koster, and stars Clifton Webb, Debra Paget, Robert Wagner, and Ruth Hussey. The film's title is taken from Sousa's "" The Stars and Stripes Forever "", which has become the best known of his military marches. While the film's storyline is loosely based on Sousa's autobiography Marching Along, the film takes considerable liberties and dramatic license, often expanding and examining themes and passages from Sousa's book. Two examples : In the film, Private Willie Little (Robert Wagner), is credited with inventing the Sousaphone and naming it after his mentor, but in reality Sousa himself designed the instrument. The inspiration for the film's title march is depicted in a scene with a voice over by Webb quoting Sousa's actual description of its creation while he was aboard ship recovering from typhoid fever. In reality, having learned of the sudden death of his band's manager, Sousa and his wife canceled their European vacation and were returning to the U.S. by steamship when the march came to him.

Upon launch, TMF's description was "" TMF is designed to replicate the rhythms of the whole family, playing the best pop videos with the biggest pop stars to become the sound track to the British family life. "" However, it had since broadened its content to show programmes from its sister channels MTV, VH1, Nick Jr. and Comedy Central, so no longer relied on just music videos. TMF broadcast on Freeview, Sky and Virgin Media and as well as in some Irish cable packages. The channel was the most viewed music video related station in the UK, according to BARB ratings. TMF had a new look on screen graphics in March 2008 to match the other British MTV channels. The previous on screen graphics were used since July 2005 and the original on screen graphics were used since October 2002. The original DOG was on the top right of the screen, it has been moved to the top left of the screen since July 2005. The new look TMF still used the old pre-2007 TMF logo whereas both the Dutch and Belgian TMF channels adapted the new logo. The DOG on music programmes was TMF : Music. ","TMF | country | Dutch

He was the only member of the Conservative front bench who consistently, openly and publicly opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Even though he was reselected by the Mid Bedfordshire Conservative Association as the Conservative candidate to recontest his seat in the House of Commons shortly before the 2005 General Election, he was forced to retire by ill health. He was criticised by the Committee on Standards and Privileges for being "" at the least negligent, at the worst careless "" in respect of a company in which he had an interest but was completely cleared of any impropriety. In the investigation by Sir Thomas Legg into MPs expenses he was one of the minority of MPs who were completely cleared of any misuse of their second home allowances.

435,Sonic the Hedgehog,"Sonic the Hedgehog is a media franchise created and produced by Sega. It is primarily a video game franchise, centering on a series of speed-based platform games. Sonic, the protagonist, is an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog with supersonic speed, capable of reaching the speed of sound. Typically, Sonic  usually along with some of his friends, such as Tails, Amy, and Knuckles  must stop antagonist Doctor Eggman's plans for world domination. The first game in the series, released in 1991, was conceived by Sega's Sonic Team division after Sega requested a mascot character. Its success spawned many sequels and helped Sega become one of the leading video game companies during the 16-bit era of the early 1990s. While the first Sonic games were side-scrolling platform games, later games expanded into other genres, such as Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games. The series and its spin-offs had sold over 89million physical copies by March 2011, and grossed over by 2014. As of 2018, the series has shifted 800million units, including free-to-play mobile game downloads. The franchise has also been spun out into other media, including cartoons, anime, and a comic book series recognized as the longest running based on a video game by Guinness World Records.

436,Western Ukraine,"Western Ukraine or West Ukraine () is a geographical and historical relative term used in reference to the western territories of Ukraine. It includes several actual historical regions such as Transcarpathia, Halychyna including Pokuttia, most of Volhynia, northern Bukovina as well as western Podolia. Less often it includes territories of eastern Volhynia, Podolia, and small portion of northern Bessarabia (eastern part of Chernivtsi Oblast). Important cities are Buchach, Chernivtsi, Drohobych, Halych (hence-Halychyna), Ivano-Frankivsk, Khotyn, Lutsk, Lviv, Mukacheve, Rivne, Ternopil, Uzhhorod and others. Western Ukraine is not an administrative category within Ukraine. It is defined mainly in the context of European history pertaining to the 20th-century wars and the ensuing period of annexations. At the onset of World War II the whole territory was incorporated into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (), following elections which are acknowledged as staged and specifically for the purpose to manufactured public consent for the transfer of land from occupied Poland to the Soviet Union as of October 22, 1939. Its historical background makes Western Ukraine uniquely different from the rest of the country, and contributes to its distinctive character of today.

It was created in 1992, mostly out of the old Frankston North. The seat is notable for having decided the 1999 state election, which proved to be the last election in which it was contested. The incumbent, Liberal-turned-independent Peter McLellan, died on election day, forcing a supplementary election a month later. Neither the Coalition nor Labor had won a majority, placing the balance of power in the hands of three independents. They deferred their decision until the supplementary election. In the 16 October supplementary election, Labor candidate Matt Viney won on a swing of 7.7 percent, resulting in a hung parliament. The independents then announced their support for Labor, making Labor leader Steve Bracks premier. ","Legislative Assembly | applies to jurisdiction | Victoria

442,Odessa (Bee Gees album),"Odessa is the sixth studio album by the Bee Gees, originally released on 30 March 1969. Regarded as the most significant of the group's Sixties albums, it was released as a double vinyl record initially in an opulent red flocked cover with gold lettering. An ambitious project, originally intended as a concept album on the loss of a fictional ship in 1899, it created tension and disagreements in the band regarding the album's direction ; finally, a dispute over which song to release as a single led to Robin Gibb temporarily leaving the group. The album was not well received by the public or the music press on release, and led to a decline in the group's fortunes until their disco period in the mid 1970s. Released in March 1969 by Polydor Records in the UK and Atco Records in the US, it was the group's fourth album released internationally, their sixth overall, and their only double album of original music. Odessa would be the final album for the band's original incarnation, and this was the last album to include guitarist Vince Melouney. The album contains "" First of May "", "" Lamplight "", "" Marley Purt Drive "" and "" Melody Fair "". The album was reissued as a single-disc in 1976 when interest was revived in the Bee Gees career, since then the album has gained increasing critical acclaim ; it was reissued again in 2009 as a deluxe 3 disc set, and is included in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

She is known for conceptual works using drawing, photography, video, collage, sculpture and performance, which address  the fleeting nature of experience, the elusiveness of desire, and the persistence of objects in a throwaway culture.  Art critic Jerry Saltz has written that her work "" not only grappl[es ] with consumerism but [ she is ] just about swallowed whole by it.  Her work also considers themes of gender identity, narcissism, privacy and information overload. She has exhibited widely throughout the United States and internationally, including a solo exhibition at Yancey Richardson Gallery in 2015, about which art critic Roberta Smith wrote,   obsessive delights await in this strange and beautiful show   She lives and works in Gloucester, Massachusetts and Brooklyn, New York.

He was a professor at the Colegio de San Nicols Obispo in Valladolid and was ousted in 1792. He served in a church in Colima and then in Dolores, Dias. After his arrival, he was shocked by the rich soil he had found. He tried to help the poor by showing them how to grow olives and grapes, but in Mexico, growing these crops was discouraged or prohibited by the authorities due to Spanish imports of the items. In 1810 he gave the famous speech, "" The Cry of Dolores "", calling upon the people to protect the interest of their King Fernando VII (held captive by Napoleon) by revolting against the European-born Spaniards who had overthrown the Spanish Viceroy. He marched across Mexico and gathered an army of nearly 90,000 poor farmers and Mexican civilians who attacked and killed both Spanish Peninsulares and Criollo elites, even though Hidalgo's troops lacked training and were poorly armed. These troops ran into an army of 6,000 well-trained and armed Spanish troops ; most of Hidalgo's troops fled or were killed at the Battle of Caldern Bridge.

Hwass's best-known written work was the 1792 publication of Encyclopedie Methodique. Although his friend, Jean Guillaume Bruguire (1750  1798), is often credited as author of the encyclopedia, the majority of the work was done by Hwass.

It is the final book in Huysmans ' cycle of four novels featuring the character Durtal, a thinly disguised portrait of the author himself. Durtal had already appeared in L-bas, En route and La cathdrale, which traced his (and the author's) conversion to Catholicism. In L'Oblat, Durtal becomes an oblate, reflecting Huysmans ' own experiences in the religious community at Ligug. Like many of Huysmans ' other novels, it has little plot. The author uses the book to examine the Christian liturgy, express his opinions about the state of Catholicism in contemporary France and explore the question of suffering (one notable passage describes the Garden of Gethsemane).

466,Vicente Genaro de Quesada,"Vicente Genaro de Quesada (1782 Havana, Cuba  15 August 1836 Madrid) was a Spanish military figure. He participated in the Battle of Burgos (1808) during the Peninsular War, leading the Royal Guard and Walloon Guard. Forming a rearguard for the shattered Spanish lines, these troops absorbed repeated charges by General Lasalle's French cavalry without yielding any ground. He later fought in the First Carlist War on the Isabeline (Liberal) side, losing the Battle of Alsasua in April 1834. After the Mutiny of La Granja in August 1836, he tried to suppress demonstrations in Madrid in support of restoring the Constitution of 1812. The next day, with the queen regent having acceded to the demands of the mutineers, he fled to the village of Hortaleza, but was captured and killed there by a crowd including members of the National Militia.

467,The Catholic Catechism (Hardon),"The Catholic Catechism is a major volume on the teachings of the Catholic Church written by John Hardon and published in 1975. It was written at the request of Pope Paul VI to counter the emergence of perceived rampant liberalism after the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). The Catholic Catechism was a significant work in the sense that it essentially brought modern Vatican II Catholic teaching and faith into one book, unlike any other before, and was a precursor to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which is the official codified teaching of the Catholic Church, written by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) and promulgated by Pope John Paul II in 1992. Hardon's Catholic Catechism remains a standard work on Catholic orthodoxy even to this day. The book is published with the nihil obstat and imprimatur. ","Catholic Church | religion | Catholic

469,Lark Force,"Lark Force was an Australian Army formation established in March 1941 during World War II for service in New Britain and New Ireland. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Scanlan, it was raised in Australia and deployed to Rabaul and Kavieng, aboard SS Katoomba, MV Neptuna and HMAT Zealandia, to defend their strategically important harbours and airfields. The objective of the force, was to maintain a forward air observation line as long as possible and to make the enemy fight for this line rather than abandon it at the first threat as the force was considered too small to withstand any invasion. Most of Lark Force was captured by the Imperial Japanese Army after Rabaul and Kavieng were captured in January 1942. The officers of Lark Force were transported to Japan, however the NCOs and men were unfortunately torpedoed by the USS Sturgeon while being transported aboard the Montevideo Maru. Only a handful of the Japanese crew were rescued, with none of the between 1,050 and 1,053 prisoners aboard surviving as they were still locked below deck.

480,Kerstin Thorborg,"Kerstin Thorborg (May 19, 1896-April 12, 1970) Born in Venjan, Sweden, the contralto Kerstin Thorborg was one of the best dramatic Wagnerian singers in the two decades between 1930 and 1950. She made her debut in 1924 singing the difficult role of Ortrud in Lohengrin. Eight years later, the famed conductor Bruno Walter engaged her for the Stdtische Oper in Berlin and became her mentor. Although a contralto, Thorborg's upper register was so secure that she sang numerous mezzo-soprano roles, including Venus, Kundry, Fricka, Waltraute, and Magdalena. She was especially known for her searingly beautiful Brangne, which was preserved on record. She also appears to wonderful advantage in the live recording of Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde, with Charles Kullmann, under Bruno Walter, at the Vienna Musikverein in 1936. In 1938, to escape the Nazis, she made her home in the United States, singing various roles at the Met. She returned to her native Sweden in 1950, after her retirement. By all accounts, Thorborg was a magnificent actor with great stage presence. In addition, she was endowed with a beautifully steady and intense tone. ","Kerstin Thorborg | place of birth | Venjan

481,Radu Lecca,"Radu D. Lecca (February 15, 1890  1980) was a Romanian spy, journalist, civil servant and convicted war criminal. A World War I veteran who served a prison term for espionage in France during the early 1930s, he was a noted supporter of antisemitic concepts and, after 1933, an agent of influence for Nazi Germany. While becoming a double agent for Romania's Special Intelligence Service (SSI), Lecca was involved in fascist politics, gained in importance during World War II and the successive dictatorships, and eventually grew close to Conductor Ion Antonescu. After 1941, Lecca was Commissioner, later Commissioner General, tasked with solving the "" Jewish Question "" in Romania, sharing Romania's responsibility for the Holocaust. Advised by the special German envoys Manfred Freiherr von Killinger and Gustav Richter and acting with Antonescu's consent, he established the Central Jewish Office (Centrala Evreiasc, CE) through which he persecuted, exploited and extorted the Romanian Jewish community, whose existence was threatened by deportations into Transnistria. The system he supervised was notoriously corrupt, with many of the funds extorted being used for the personal benefit of Lecca or his political associates. Commissioner Lecca was also instrumental in negotiating the Final Solution's application in Romania, a plan which was eventually abandoned, while considering mass emigration to Palestine in exchange for payments. After the August 1944 Coup removed Antonescu and aligned Romania with the Allies, Lecca was among the high-ranking Romanian politicians arrested and transported to the Soviet Union. Upon his 1946 return, Lecca was Antonescu's co-defendant in a People's Tribunal case, and was condemned to death. His sentence was commuted into life imprisonment and later reduced by the communist regime. After his release, Lecca wrote memoirs which make various controversial claims, and which minimize his and Antonescu's participation in Holocaust-related crimes. ","Radu D.

486,Rudolf Halin,"Rudolf Halin (February 3, 1934, Uerdingen  November 14, 2014, Mlln) was a German graph theorist, known for defining the ends of infinite graphs, for Halin's grid theorem, for extending Menger's theorem to infinite graphs, and for his early research on treewidth and tree decomposition. He is also the namesake of Halin graphs, a class of planar graphs constructed from trees by adding a cycle through the leaves of the given tree ; earlier researchers had studied the subclass of cubic Halin graphs but Halin was the first to study this class of graphs in full generality. Halin earned his doctorate from the University of Cologne in 1962, under the supervision of Klaus Wagner and Karl Drge, after which he joined the faculty of the University of Hamburg. In February 1994, a colloquium was held at the University of Hamburg in honor of Halin's 60th birthday. ","Klaus Wagner | employer | University of Cologne

487,Church of Saint Francis of Assisi (Ouro Preto),"The Church of Saint Francis of Assisi is a Rococo Catholic church in Ouro Preto, Brazil. Its erection began in 1766 after a design by the Brazilian architect and sculptor Antnio Francisco Lisboa, otherwise known as Aleijadinho. Lisboa designed both the structure of the church and the carved decorations on the interior, which were only finished towards the end of the 19th century. The circular bell towers and the oculus closed by a relief were original features in religious architecture of that time in Brazil. The faade has a single entrance door under a soapstone frontispiece under a relief depicting Saint Francis receiving the stigmata. The interior is richly decorated with golden woodwork, statues and paintings, and the wooden ceiling displays a painting by Manuel da Costa Atade. Due to its architecture and historical significance regarding eighteenth century gold mining, this church is classified on the UNESCO World Heritage List. ","Ouro Preto | country | Brazil

492,Scimitar oryx,"The scimitar oryx or scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), also known as the Sahara oryx, is a species of Oryx once widespread across North Africa which went extinct in the wild in 2000. It has a long taxonomic history since its scientific description in 1816 by Lorenz Oken, who named it Oryx algazel. This antelope stands a little more than at the shoulder. The males weigh and the females weigh. The coat is white with a red-brown chest and black markings on the forehead and down the length of the nose. The calves are born with a yellow coat without distinguishing marks ; their coats change to adult coloration at 312 months old. The scimitar oryx formed herds of mixed sexes of up to 70 members, usually guided by the bulls. They inhabited semideserts and deserts and were adapted to live in the extreme heat, with their efficient cooling mechanism and very low requirement of water. Scimitar oryx feed on foliage, grasses, succulent plants and plant parts during the night or early morning. Births peak between March and October. After a gestation of eight to nine months, one calf is born. Soon after, the female has a postpartum estrus. The scimitar oryx was once widespread across northern Africa. Its decline began as a result of climate change during the neolithic period, and later it was hunted extensively for its horns. Today, it is bred in captivity in special reserves in Tunisia, Morocco and Senegal and on private exotic animal ranches in the Texas Hill Country. In 2016 a reintroduction program was launched and currently a small herd has been successfully reintroduced in Chad. The scimitar oryx was domesticated in Ancient Egypt and is believed to have been used as food and sacrificed as offerings to gods. Wealthy people in Ancient Rome also bred them. The use of their valuable hides began in the Middle Ages. The unicorn myth may have originated from sightings of a scimitar oryx with a broken horn. The scimitar oryx was the emblem of the ancient Egyptian Oryx nome and today is the animal symbol of the Sahara Conservation Fund. ",,,,

495,War between Armenia and Iberia,"The War between Armenia and Iberia (AD 51) is known chiefly through its description in Tacitus ' Annals. The war took place as a delicate balance of power between the Roman and Parthian empires was in place in the Caucasus. Rome was then ruled by Claudius, Parthia by Vologases I. Two Iberian brothers then ruled the Caucasian kingdoms, Pharasmanes I in Iberia, Mithridates in Armenia. They were both dependent on Roman support, which had installed Mithridates on the Armenian throne in 35 AD. However, 15 years later, trust between the brothers had deteriorated, which Tacitus blames on the intrigues of Pharasmanes ' son Rhadamistus. Fearing usurpation by Rhadamistus, his father convinced him to make war upon his uncle and claim the Armenian throne for himself. The Iberians invaded with a large army and surrounded Mithridates at the fortress of Gorneas (Garni), which was garrisoned by the Romans under the command of Caelius Pollio, a prefect, and Casperius, a centurion. Rhadamistus was unable to take the fortress by assault or by siege. Pollio, swayed by bribery from Rhadamistus, betrayed Mithridates and induced the Roman soldiers to threaten the capitulation of the garrison. Under this threat, Mithridates left the fortress in order to make peace with Rhadamistus. Rhadamistus then executed Mithridates and his sons, despite a promise of non-violence, and became King of Armenia. Of this usurpation, Tacitus wrote "" Rhadamistus might retain his ill-gotten gains, as long as he was hated and infamous ; for this was more to Rome's interest than for him to have succeeded with glory "". However, faced with this upset of the regional balance and fearing that Armenia and Iberia would unite as a single powerful kingdom in the hands of Rhadamistus, Tiridates entered Armenia with Parthian support in 53 AD. After 2 years of war, the Armenian nobility revolted and replaced Rhadamistus with the Arsacid prince Tiridates. This was unacceptable to Rome, and started the Roman  Parthian War of 5863.
