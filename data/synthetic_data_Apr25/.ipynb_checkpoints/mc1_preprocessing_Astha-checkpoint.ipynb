Her courage in the face of suffering sets an example for us all.\\nAbstract\\n\\nIn 1997 a group of citizens from Elodis, Kronos, formed a grassroots effort to address a problem of contamination of their irrigation, culinary and potable water supply affecting the nearby Tiskele River.  The formation of this movement and its transformation into a formal social movement organization (SMO) is the topic of this thesis.\\n\\n\\nCase Study:  Protectors of Kronos, a History\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nElodis is a rural agricultural town of about 6500 persons that lies 25 km from Abila, capital city of Kronos.  The town was incorporated in 1834, but had already been settled for hundreds of years prior.  Its primary industry is floodplain farming, and is almost entirely dependent upon the nearby Tiskele River for irrigation and culinary water.  \\n\\nThe Issue:  Water Contamination\\n\\nIn early 1997 certain Elodis citizens convened a special town hall meeting to address their concerns about the increasing rate of illness and declining crop production the town had experienced over the last 18 months.  Armed with statistics form the Elodis Community Health Center, the citizens pointed toward an unusually high rate of cancer, neurological diseases, birth defects and respiratory illness.   They asked that the City Council approach the Kronos government to address the issues.  The specific source of the contamination was unclear, but several persons believed it had to be a result of the gas drilling operations several kilometers upstream.  This view was not universally embraced by the Elodis citizens at this point, but several persons agreed to explore the possibilities.\\n\\nThe City Council held several closed-door sessions and several public sessions to consider how to approach Kronos officials about the problem.    \\n\\nInitial Stage:  Formation of the Grassroots Effort\\n\\nWhen it became clear the Council could not agree on a course of action the Elodis citizens decided to address the problem independently.    At this point the SMO was in the initial stages of development, being still a group of citizens with similar concerns.  The primary actors in the initial stage formed the seven founding members of the Protectors of Kronos SMO:  Henk Bodrogi, Carmine Osvaldo, Ale L. Hanne, Jeroen Karel, Valentine Mies, Yanick Cato and Joreto Katell.  \\n\\nLeaders\\n\\nDuring the early stages of the effort Henk Bodrogi emerged as the leader.  While Bodrogi had no prior training in managing a social movement organization, he had served in the Kronos military as for four years before taking over the family farm when his father passed.  By 1997 Bodrogi was a well-respected member of the community, very experienced with floodplain agriculture techniques, and involved with civic business groups and considered a natural leader. Around this time, Bodrogi\\u2019s wife, Mira became ill with cardiopulmonary symptoms consistent with ethylene glycol contamination.\\n\\nA lifelong friend of Bodrogi, Carmine Osvaldo also served with him in the Kronos military.  Osvaldo ran one of the hardware retail stores in Elodis and served on the board of the Chamber of Commerce.  Because of his business experience, Osvaldo became the primary navigator of the relationship between the burgeoning social movement, the Kronos government and outside agencies.\\n\\nFirst Steps\\n\\nThe first steps of the group were to take the statistics assembled by the Elodis Community Health Center to the Abila office of the Minister of Interior, to request assistance to diagnose the problems associated with the Tiskele River.   Bodrogi presented the health statistics reports at several meetings, but was met with skepticism.  Feeling stymied, the group returned to Elodis to form a new approach.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Jeroen Karel and Valentine Mies had been conducting research and found a GAStech waste discharge pipe from the gas drilling operation was spilling raw waste into water that fed the Tiskele River, about 25 km upstream from Elodis.  They brought their discovery to Bodrogi, who had just returned with Osvaldo from their attempts at resolution in Abila.\\n\\nForming an Identity:  Protectors of Kronos\\n\\nOne of the critical steps for the formation of an SMO is to establish an identity that will help bring their message to the citizenry and the government.   Osvaldo proposed to the activists they form a social movement organization with an identity brand and a specific agenda:  To bring clean water to Elodis and clean up the contamination in the River.  The group formalized their identity with a name, the Protectors of Kronos (POK), and a logo, consisting of an open right hand within a white circle on a black background.\\n\\nOsvaldo reached out to an international agency specializing in clear water for communities, Wellness for All (WFA).   The WFA Project Manager Joclyn Reynolds began formal scientific testing of the Tiskele River water, and advised the POK to engage the GAStech company regarding the issue of water contamination.  \\n\\nMembers of the POK repeatedly requested meetings with GAStech representatives, but received nothing but denials for several months.  This continued until Hank Fluss, the Chief Operating Officer at GAStech, agreed to a meeting with Bodrogi.  The meeting took place outside range of media, and involved only Fluss, Bodrogi and Osvaldo.  Bodrogi reported he felt encouraged by the seriousness with which Fluss took the POK agenda, and told the POK he would take their issues back to the CEO of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr.\\n\\nEvents Take a Turn for the Worse\\n\\nUp to this point, the POK had primarily used statistics about health issues and names of toxins in their agenda, and then on August 18 1998 ten-year old Juliana Vann, daughter of Lemual and Neske Vann, died of leukemia associated with benzene toxicity.\\n\\nThis event also brought the first serious schism in the POK.  Valentine Mies suggested using her image as a rallying point, but Bodrogi and Yanick Cato were steadfastly against this approach.    After Mies negotiated approval from Juliana\\u2019s family, Bodrogi and Cato relented and the POK began using what would become an iconic image of Juliana smiling down over a daisy, tinted in Warhol-esque colors.  It was then that public awareness for POK across Kronos began rising.\\n\\nThe initial results from the WFA water testing in 1998 found high levels of chemicals associated with Hyper Acidic Substrate Removal, and technology associated with natural gas drilling operations.  Several toxic substances were found Elodis water, including benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium.  WFA published these results in international health organization conferences, bringing increasingly widespread awareness of the Elodisan situation.\\n\\nMembership Numbers Increase\\n\\nFollowing the death of Juliana and the publication of the scientific reports, the number of persons interested in joining the POK efforts increased.  Up to this point most of the work had been done by the founding members and their extended families; however increased media awareness brought additional interest.  Jeroen Karel stepped into the role as recruiter and personnel organizer.\\n\\nAlliance Stage:  Operations move to Abila\\n\\nWith the establishment of their agenda and international acknowledgement of their issue, the Protectors of Kronos are recognized as a formal SMO, and moved their primary lobbying efforts to the capital city of Kronos.  They stage a series of public rallies, and continued their efforts to press the government for action.  With public pressure mounting, the office of the Minister of Health responded by agreeing to a series of meetings.   By July 1999 Cesare Nespola, Minister of Health, announced he would sponsor a  bill on oil and gas development, the funds of which would be used for health care and clean water projects.\\n\\nWhile they appear to have had public support, the POK continued to find most doors closed to them.  The only traction the POK appeared to make is with the Minister of Health.   Negotiations with GAStech via Hank Fluss didn\\u2019t continue due to Fluss\\u2019 declining health. \\n\\nThe POK continued to press the Kronos government; however it became increasingly clear their every effort would be blocked. \\n\\nIn March 2001 the Government of Kronos Assembly voted down the tax proposed by Minister Nespola, and in June 2001 Minister Nespola died suddenly.  With Nespola\\u2019s death, the POK lost the only government official who was willing to engage with them.\\n\\nWhen an underground methane deposit ignited at the GAStech mining operations near Elodis in August 2001, POK demanded an investigation of GAStech by the Kronos government.   In response, the POK staged a protest at the GAStech fields.  This protest marked the first time POK supporters were arrested. One protester threw a sign at a government vehicle, which precipitated the arrests.  POK member Elian Karel, 20-year old son of Jeroen, was present at the August protest.  He entreated the POK to disengage with the drivers and deescalate the situation by withdrawing from the road.  The POK members retreated, allowing the drivers to move along, and Karel was heralded as a hero for preventing further violence.\\n\\nChanging of the Guard\\n\\nIt was at this point that Henk Bodrogi and the other original POK members began considering they might not be able to keep up the pace required to maintain pressure on the government.  All the men were in late middle age, and many were suffering health problems so common to the Elodisians. \\n\\nElian Karel had been involved with the POK, assisting his father with recruitment and organizing rallies.  Following the August 2001 incident, Henk began taking Karel to rallies and turning over public appearance responsibilities to Karel.   In October 2001 Henk Bodrogi stepped down as leader of the POK, formally handing his responsibilities to Elian Karel.  The remaining founding members would follow by the end of that year.\\n\\nKarel reinvigorated the POK mission.  But he began shifting the agenda to include an additional issue.\\n\\nIt had become clear through the lack of government response to POK requests and the protection the government offered GAStech following malfeasance that an unusual and potentially illegal alliance had been formed between the GAStech executives and the Kronos government officials.  The POK shifted their mission to include an accounting of actions by government officials.  The public concern about bribes and corruption would change the direction of the Protectors of Kronos, and bring many more supporters into their fold.\"\n",

Andrews\\nJanuary 2009\\n\\nThe Protectors of Kronos (POK) is a political activist movement that began as a small group of seven citizens concerned about contamination from drilling at the Tiskele Bend gas fields.  Today the POK has grown under the charismatic leadership of Elian Karel to loosely organized group with an estimated membership of 200-300 people. \\nThis report summarizes the history of the POK and assesses the likely future of the group.\\n\\nThe POK as a Grassroots Movement (1997-2001)\\nThe protectors of Kronos emerged from the Elodis township, a rural agricultural town of about 6500 persons that lies 25 km from Abila, capital city of Kronos.  The people of Elodis are primarily engaged in floodplain farming which is dependent upon the Tiskele River for irrigation.  In early 1997, citizens of Elodis began to be concerned about an abnormal increase in the occurrence of illnesses such as cancer, birth defects, respiratory illnesses, and neurological diseases, in addition to a marked decrease in crop yield.  When the Elodis City Council failed to take action on the citizen\\u2019s call for investigation into possible contamination of the river, a small grassroots group of seven citizens formed with the goal of bringing their concerns to the central Kronos government.  \\nThe grassroots organization coalesced under the leadership of Henk Bodrogi, a floodplain farmer who had joined the group after his wife had become ill with cardiopulmonary symptoms consistent with ethylene glycol contamination.  Bodrogi was a popular local figure who was well regarded for his leadership in civic groups.  Although he had served in the Kronosian military, Bodrogi lacked experience in dealing with the Kronosian government and for which he turned to his lifelong friend, Carmine Osvaldo. Osvaldo, who had served in the military with Bodrogi, was a member of the board for the Elodis Chamber of Commerce and who used his business experience to form relationships with the Kronosian government and outside agencies.\\nOsvaldo proposed to the activists that they form a social movement organization with an identity brand and a specific agenda as a mechanism for interfacing with the government of Kronos.  The group chose the name \\u201cProtectors of Kronos\\u201d and developed a logo consisting of an open right hand rising from the land on a black background.  Additionally, Osvaldo contacted Wellness for All (WFA), an international agency that specialized in providing clean water for rural communities.  WFA tested water from the Tiskele River both upstream and downstream of the Tiskele Bend gas fields and confirmed the presence of contaminants consistent with pollution from Hyper Acidic Substrate Removal, a gas drilling technique employed by GAStech at the Tiskele Bend fields.  The WFA published these test results in several international journals, which gathered attention in the media and brought new members to the POK. With the increase in POK membership, Bodrogi and Osvaldo turned to Jeroen Karel, father of current POK leader Elian Karel, to organize recruitment and personnel.  \\nArmed with the WFA test results, Bodrogi and Osvaldo sought to meet with GAStech to discuss the contamination issue, and after much persistence, were able to meet with Hank Fluss, GAStech\\u2019s Chief Operating Officer.  Fluss assured the men that he would discuss the contamination issue with GAStech CEO Sten Sanjorge, Jr., but there is no evidence that Sanjorge made any changes to his company\\u2019s operations at the Tiskele Bend fields.\\nThe publicity garnered from the WFA test results convinced Osvaldo to step up the POK\\u2019s lobbying efforts in the capital city of Abila.  After numerous meetings with low-level government functionaries and many peaceful rallies in front of the capitol, Bodrogi and Osvaldo were invited to attend several meetings with the Minister of Health, Cesare Nespola.  Nespola investigated the POK claims and eventually grew concerned enough that in July 1999 he sponsored a bill to create an additional tax on oil and gas development, the funds from which would be specifically earmarked for health care and clean water projects in rural areas.  The tax measure was defeated in March 2001, and Nespola died soon after.  Nespola\\u2019s successor, Vincent Kapelou, the 28-year-old nephew of President Kapelou, was less sympathetic to the POK\\u2019s plight and refused to re-introduce the tax measure to the General Assembly.\\nWith this setback to the POK\\u2019s efforts to engage the government in addressing the contamination of the Tiskele River, the group turned to protesting at the entrance to the government-controlled Tiskele Bend fields in August 2001 in order to refocus attention on their cause.  The protest was successful, and became the first of many POK public protests.\\nFollowing the August protest, Henk Bodrogi, who was suffering from health problems related to the Tiskele River contamination, decided to step down as leader of the POK.  Bodrogi chose Elian Karel, a young charismatic man, as his replacement.  Within one month of Henk\\u2019s departure from the POK, all of the other original seven members of the group also quit and returned home to Elodis.\\n\\nA Time of Peaceful Engagement and Recruitment (2002-2004)\\nElian Karel\\u2019s dynamic leadership and charismatic personality energized the remaining POK members.  Karel recognized that the POK needed to expand its membership if it were to survive and he focused his efforts on recruiting additional members in Abila.  Karel staged numerous peaceful environmental rallies and spent considerable energy working the crowds.  When not planning or working the rallies, Karel spent his time meeting with many of the social and environmental activist groups in the capitol city.  He proved to be a persuasive recruiter and many small activist groups joined forces with the POK.\\nFrustrated by a lack of government engagement during this time, Karel shifted the POK\\u2019s mission to include concern over government accountability and corruption.  This additional focus aligned with popular concerns of bribery and fraud, and won Karel additional supporters.\\n\\nActivism and Protest (2005-2008)\\nKarel continued the group\\u2019s mission of peaceful protest in order to seek government action on the contamination of the Tiskele River, but the tone of the POK protests changed markedly after the Tiskele River caught fire in 2005.  At their recent rallies, the POK has alleged that government corruption and possible collusion has resulted in little to no oversight of gas and oil field operations.  POK rallies have also been marked by an increase in civil disobedience and militant, violent action.  It is unclear if this represents a change in tactics by Karel, or if it is evidence that he has lost some measure of control over the more radical members of his group.\\n\\nThree Possible Futures (2009 and forward)\\nSocial movements go through stages of growth and change, in some cases growing systematically in strength and impact over time and in others fluctuating in response to internal dynamics and external pressures.  To accomplish its goals, a social movement needs to win over the neutrality, sympathies, opinions, and even support of an increasingly larger majority of the populace and involve many of them in the process of opposition and change. The central agency of opposition must slowly change from the new wave activists and groups to the great majority of nonpolitical populace and the mainstream political forces as they are convinced to agree with the movement's position. The majority stage is a long process of eroding the social, political, and economic supports that enable the powerholders to continue their policies. \\nMovements can also cease to exist, most commonly when a movement\\u2019s central cause has been addressed.  Movements may also end due to internal factors such as failure to adapt political agendas to changing contexts or concerns of members, or internal conflicts over politics and power.  Other reasons for movements to cease include systematic suppression by external forces that dissipate actors and make action impossible.  This can include targeted harassment and killing of key activists, and campaigns to discredit visible leaders.  While repression can suppress a social movement, it may make militancy more likely if it suppresses moderate alternatives, radicalizes remaining supporters, and creates martyrs and myths that militants use to justify their actions.\\nIn the context of the lifecycle of a social movement, the authors see three possible futures for the POK: dissolution, consolidation into a political entity, or radicalization.  The most likely future is the one in which the POK, like so many other social movements before it, dissolves before it can achieve its goals.\\n\\nDissolution of the POK \\nThose who joined the POK when it was growing expect rapid success. If this is not realized, members experience feelings of hopelessness and burn-out and will leave the organization.  This future is the most likely, especially if Elian Karel or others of the dominant POK personalities fail to make progress in engaging the Kronosian government or become disillusioned and leave the group.  Dissolution is also likely if the Kronosian government suppresses the POK\\u2019s ability to act, leaving the membership feeling powerless and ineffective. \\n\\nThe POK as a Political Entity\\nThe POK, under the leadership of its popular leader Elian Karel, could become a powerful political entity.  This future can be achieved if Karel is successful in consolidating the POK membership, formalizing a leadership structure and popularize their agenda.  Karel will need to build a broad-based pluralized movement, conduct massive public education and conversion, renew the use of mainstream political and social institutions, and develop programs in which large numbers of common citizens can become actively involved in programs that challenge current traditions, policies, and laws.\\n\\nRadicalization of the POK\\nA large number of the POK members recruited since 2001 are under-employed and under-educated young males who feel as if they have no future since their country is changing from an agrarian-based economy to an energy-based economy in which they are unable to compete against outsiders for high paying jobs.  Elian Karel has so far been able to control these members and channel their energy towards political protest.  Should Karel leave the POK, leadership of the group would probably fall to either Silvia Marek or Mandor Vann (see personality profiles below).  These young disaffected members of the POK would likely prove a challenge for Marek\\u2019s leadership skills and many may break ranks from her program of peaceful engagement.  Mandor Vann\\u2019s military background makes him more likely to be able to restrain the actions of the disaffected young male members of the POK than Marek, but his ties to Isia and Juliana Vann may make him more sympathetic to a course of more radical action to promote the POK agenda.  In either case there exists a possibility of radicalization within the POK ranks.\\n\\nProfile of Dominant POK Personalities (2009)\\nElian Karel\\nCurrent leader of the POK, Karel is a dynamic speaker whose charismatic leadership abilities have won him a substantial group of loyal supporters.  The POK continues to grow in size under Karel\\u2019s leadership.  His growing popularity with the citizens of Kronos and certain media organizations is likely to gain interest in the POK agenda among General Assembly members.\\n\\nSilvia Marek\\nMarek was the leader and co-founder of a small environmental activist group, Save Our Wildlands, which formed at the University of Abila in 1998.  Elian Karel recruited Marek and her group to join the POK in 2005.  Marek is a charismatic speaker with a passion for environmental awareness and the vegan lifestyle.  She believes persistent, peaceful protest will eventually gain the POK the necessary political influence to finally address the environmental contamination stemming from years of unrestricted gas drilling at the Tiskele Bend fields.  Marek has organized several peaceful POK rallies in Abila and is seen among the POK members as a leader, although she is not as widely respected throughout the group as Karel.\\n\\nMandor Vann\\nMandor Vann, uncle to Isia and Juliana Vann, has been with the POK since retiring from the Kronos military in 2004.  Vann, who was an enlisted linguist, spent much of his military career serving at the Kronosian embassies in Tethys and Asteria.  As the POK member with the most experience in government, Vann has become the group\\u2019s top political strategist.  POK members have great respect for Vann and describe him as intense, intelligent, organized, and ambitious.\\n\\nIsia Vann\\nIsia Vann, an Elodis native, is the older brother of Juliana Vann, the 10-year-old girl who died in 1998 after an illness related to drinking contaminated water from the Tiskele River, and nephew to Mandor Vann.  Isia is one of several POK members who advocate for a more forceful approach to gaining attention to the plight of people living downstream of Tiskele Bend.  He has been arrested several times for civil disobedience and trespassing during POK rallies.\\n\\nLucio Jakab\\nLucio Jakab was a member and co-founder of a small environmental activist group, Save Our Wildlands, which formed at the University of Abila in 1998.  Elian Karel convinced Jakab and the other members of Save Our Wildlands to join forces with the POK in 2005.  Jakab is an activist who believes that the habitat of wild life unique to Kronos is imperiled by drilling, logging, and pollution.  A media communications professional, Jakab is responsible for many of the handbills, signs, banners, and slogans used by the POK.\\n\\nLorenzo Di Stefano\\nLorenzo Di Stefano is a professor of environmental science at the University of Abila and a POK activist who believes that the government needs to enact stronger environmental laws to protect the country\\u2019s agrarian lifestyle.  Di Stefano has recently authored several scientific articles on the environmental contamination associated with the Hyper Acidic Substrate Removal (HASR) technique used at several Kronosian gas fields and has advocated for regulations that would outlaw this technique.\"\n",

Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos. \\n\\nTwo weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend.  \\\"The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away. \\n\\nThe change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys. \\n\\nEstablished in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis. \\n\\nWith a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a cafe. Here you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations. \\n\\n\\\"We've made a good living for a long time,\\\" Reese tells me. \\n\\nI asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.   \\n\\nI caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers.\"\n",

But not only which is they, which and why they protest? \\n\\nThe Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis in accordance with the opinion of Wellness for All(WFA), an international group of safety of water. The POK was launched to give the attention to thequestions of clean water surrounding Elodis to the government of Kronos and of the world. The POK affirms that the site of international natural gas drilling of curve of GAStech Tiskele is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional fields surrounding Elodis. \\n\\nIn 1998, WFA carried out test on the water of Elodis finding the levels high of benzene, arsenic of toluene and xylene, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The test of a following report released by an attention and pressure on the international government and GAStech brought by WFA to the act. However, with reducing WFA in fragments due to the questions of placement, the requests of the POK were mainly ignored and reduced the value. \\n\\nMoreover in 1998, Juliana Vann, ten years old and previously healthy - died of a prolonged disease, which WFA claimed  was caused by contamination of water.

Karel had been implied POK since its beginning since his/her father, Jeroen Karel, were an original member.  The death of Elan Karel in 2009 was marked for spontaneous examples of protest around Abila. The day of his death, June 19, saw protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence additional. \\n\\nThe POK evolved of the peaceful protests and the demonstrations requiring the action of government to more violent activities including riots while they claim that the government made little with nothing by addressing the contamination, the intoxications, and the deaths suffered by their people.

The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis.

But Sanjorge finishes requesting itself to produce a report for the government of Tethan that recommends the best ways to make sure that Tethys continues producing the energy per decades to come.\\n\\nThe matter of easy-to-obtaining has taken place, so to keep to come from the gas it will need much investment and new readier techniques, such as the hyperacid techniques of the retirement of the substratum developed by the company in 1974. \\n\\nIt so thanks for ready people as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, center has reached what wishes each place in where the raw materials are discovered to do.

But the projects in Europe have been slow to remove, surrounded with the opposition of the government and local communities.\\n\\nMany ecologists think that the hyperacid retirement of the substratum can damage marine atmospheres, and oppose the extraction of the new resources of the fossil fuel. But perforating coast outside avoids the necessity of the difficult negotiations with the local advice, communities and landholders.\\n\\nIn agreement with existing geologic data, SanJorge thinks that a considerable amount of gas is in the place - up to 100 cubical feet trill\\u00f3n, that would be more than the estimations of GAStech for their terrestrial resources. There is also the possibility of finding the oil.\\n\\nGAStech has considered that the resources coast outside of the gas of the slate of the total of Kronos could be between five and 10 times the terrestrial size of the available one of the resources.\\n\\n\\\"We are that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\\\" said very comfortable SanJorge.  \\\"Is anyone of that one explotable?

He is perfectly reasonable that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyperacid technology of the retirement of the substratum will have so advanced and the way of which we took care outside of the ambient coast we will have so advanced that this could be a really great industry.

He is much more hard to be successful today. Foreign necessity of CEOs to play under its expectations. There are no easy triumphs in Kronos. The foreign competition between Kronosian and companies are resistant. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the minds of the population.\\n\\nBut there is less difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of the opinion. The personnel of Kronos works hardly like hardly, she is respectful of her work and has he himself desire for the success. Also they know to appreciate to the efficient communication and a talented leader.\\n\\nWhat foreign leader needs to do it is to learn how to communicate the \\\"way of Kronosian\\\" and to take time to understand its personnel.\\n\\nQ:  Can you elaborate?\\n\\nA: There are many cultural differences in communicating. [Considerar] the notes. Foreign CEOs always confused and is frustrated when somebody in Kronos sends a note [] and counts on a simple answer of yes/no. In place they obtain a very long answer that it does not answer its initial question.\\n\\nThe people of Kronos do not have taste to take responsibility. They scare it to lose his works and she does not have taste of being forced in saying something that it does not wish a. Foreign necessity of CEOs to take this in consideration and to need to take the time to understand how to communicate.\\n\\nThe patience is key. The transparency can be an excellent way to obtain around this. It is an European value that Kronosians is very responsivo a. The imposition of him in a company can make the trip of a foreign CEO in Kronos a much more pleasant experience.\\n\\nQ:  Which is the challenges of the pipe a foreign CEO can do in front on arrival in Kronos?\\n\\nA: It is sometimes the simplest things that they can be desafiadoras, like obtaining of A to B in a taxi. The power to obtain around is taken easily for granted and not being able to do so it creates a great sense of the insecurity. In Kronos you never are safe if his conductor falls to him dull in the feasible line. This can look like as a small edition but on a daily base is very annoying.\\n\\nAnother one is becoming familiar with its equipment and with whom you are working. The often foreign right of the passage of CEOs of the plane and in an office completely of the fellow workers of Kronos. They do not have any idea that is, how they work or how they are described are. This can be confused. \\n\\nQ:  Can you give some extremities in how a foreign CEO can prepare yourself?\\n\\nA: The first thing that would say is to prepare its family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new surroundings of work. This can affect personal life. The family and the work who mix themselves are practical very common here. The people of Kronos work in extra hours and socialize with her colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear limit between the work and the family.\\n\\nForeign CEOs must also make how he is resistant is the competition and how much hard work must be put inside to be successful -- often much more that in its countries of origin. The language is a great edition.\\n\\n[But] does not concern you at the most is prepared, the true experience of the work and to live in Kronos it will always surprise to him.\\n\\nQ:  How difficult - or easy - is to being a foreign CEO in Kronos?\\n\\nA: Generally, I think that being a CEO he is hard. There are many of pressure, the atmosphere is resistant and is difficult to find a balance with its personal life.\\n\\nWhen an equipment of hears them to Kronos that a CEO is coming from overseas assumes is a problem. But, cultural they do not have an edition with the foreigners. \\n\\nQ:  Hay the situations in which the foreign executive being is really an advantage?\\n\\nA: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not deliver any attack then to locate he is a net one harms. But in certain negotiations or certain editions such as luxury merchandize, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.\\n\\nThe foreign CEO has better knowledge of an industry and can sometimes bring the access to the overseas markets.

Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.\\n \\\"We've worked the land for a long time - maybe 200 years, maybe a bit more,\\\" Henk Bodrogi told me as he picked over a container of bolts, searching for the right size.  \\\"Over the years we've added a few hectares here and there.  It keeps us busy.\\\"\\nBusy is an understatement, as I found when I prodded the wiry farmer to tell me more.\\n\\\"I usually head to the fields before sun up,\\\" Mr. Henk Bodrogi tells me. \\\"My wife gets the kids up and heading to school, then she'll make a little something for us to eat for lunch and work alongside me until dinner.  When the children get home from school they do their chores, and we're all back at the house most times by dark.\\\"\\n\\\"We do this most days,\\\" he adds, \\\"except for worship days.\\\"\\nBodrogi identifies the appropriate bolt and chats with the cashier about kids and school as he completes his purchase.\\n\\\"We all know one another here,\\\" Bodrogi explains as we leave. \\\"Most families have lived here for generations.  The first new people that came to town were with that gas company that built a few years back.\\\"\\nI ask Bodrogi if business has been good. \\n\\\"We were doing pretty good until recently.  Profits were good and we add acreage, or upgrade equipment.  Then we started having all this trouble with the crops.\\\"\\nIn what way, I asked.\\n\\\"The crops aren't producing like they have in the past.  It took a while to figure out, then one of the city officers figured out to call in a water specialist.  When they tested it they said the water was contaminated.\\\"\\nBodrodgi sighed, and with a beleaguered look in his eye he thanked me for my interest and told me he had to head back home.  The tractor had to be fixed before they could work the next day.  I thanked him and watched him climb into his truck and head out of town.\\nThe water specialist turned out to be the international agency \\\"Wellness For All\\\", an international agency with a mission to bring healthy water to communities distressed by natural disasters, draught and - coincidentally - oil and gas development.\\nI caught up with a representative from Wellness for All the next day.  Joclyn Reynolds is project coordinator for \\\"Wellness for All\\\".  She spoke to me over a satellite call from her field office in Southeast Asia where she was setting up relief efforts following an earthquake. Ms. Reynolds agreed to speak to me for a few minutes between meetings about their work in Elodis.\\n\\\"We were contacted by a city official about a problem they were having with their local water.  In the last few years agriculture had foundered, and the incidence of certain illnesses and birth defects had risen.  The Elodis drinking water comes from the Tiskele River, as does all the water for farming, so we looked for a source upstream.  We found sources of production waste disposal at the GAStech operation upstream.  Tests showed high levels of benzene, toluene, xylene arsenic, lead and selenium, among other toxins. \\\"\\n\\\"Can these substances occur naturally?\\\" I asked her.\\n\\\"Not in these amounts, and not this suddenly.  Groundwater contamination is usually the result of human activity.  The GAStech pipes are releasing contaminants into a pond.  The toxins are forming a subsurface plume that seeps into the Tiskele River from which the residents of Elodis draw their drinking water and irrigation for the crops.\\\"\\n\\\"Did you talk to GAStech about this?\\\"\\n\\\"Oh yes,\\\" she replied.  \\\"At first we believed we were gaining traction.  We met several times with GAStech representatives, including one of the senior executives, Hank Fluss.  He personally assured us GAStech would act responsibly to provide material and financial assistance toward cleanup efforts.  After a time, though, it became clear that while Mr. Fluss was earnest it was Sanjorge who makes the decisions.  It is apparent that he [Sanjorge] has no interest in the wellbeing of the residents of Elodis, or the environment.\\\"\\nSten Sanjorge, Jr., who had inherited his share in the company from his father in 1990, had developed a reputation for cutthroat business practices.\\n\\\"When we didn't make headway with GAStech,\\\" Reynolds continued, \\\"the community leaders decided to approach the government of Kronos for assistance.   Per our policy -and with permission from the Elodis leaders - we published the test results in an official public document.  The Elodis leaders then approached the government officials as citizens of a Kronesian community armed with the scientific analysis.  Our agency assured them we would again be available to help in any way when those agreements were finalized.\\\"\\nAt this point Ms Reynolds was called away from the phone, so I returned to my editor friend, Pondo Reese to tell finish the story.\\nPart Three will be published May 15, 1998\"\n",

Bouro.  Today, as they have every day for over 250 years, residents will rise to tend the rich floodplain land that provides nourishment for the People of Kronos.\\nTwo weeks prior I received an email from an old friend, Pondo Reese, now the editor of the Elodis Weekly Journal, an agriculture paper serving the community around Tiskele Bend. In his email he described a once bountiful region now distressed by contamination, struggling to find solutions to a worsening problem.  I decided to investigate.\\n\\\"We didn't make the connection at first,\\\" Reese told me when I met with him at his office.  \\\"The gas company had been built a few years back in '94, and our problems didn't start right away.   After a couple of harvests, we saw a decline in the production.   We thought perhaps it was just a hiccup, and things would get better.  Then when the kids started getting sick we took a harder look at what could have changed.\\\"\\nThe change turned out to be GAStech International, an international corporation run by Sten Sanjorge Jr, a business tycoon out of Tethys.\\nEstablished in 1961, the GAStech corporation began as a family-owned business providing local trucking services in Tethys.  The two founders - Sten Sanjorge Sr and Hank Fluss - found wildcat drilling to be more lucrative, and thus began a series of environmental disasters and financial scandals that eventually ran Sanjorge Sr into an early grave and drove Fluss into a marginal role in his own company.  With the death of Sanjorge Sr, the son took the helm of GAStech firmly in his grasp and broadened its influence further afield, eventually landing at the doorstep of the small peaceful township of Elodis.\\nWith a population of 6500, most residents of Elodis live in one- and two-story houses on small farms.  A smaller number of families live in the township along a main street with two markets, two hardware stores, one gas station and a caf\\u00e9 where you can buy lunch, pick up your mail and purchase a litre of milk to bring home.  Families have lived in Elodis for generations.\\n\\\"We've made a good living for a long time,\\\" Reese tells me. \\\"The population has been steadily increasing.  Crop production has been good.  For the most part, kids haven't left for the city as they have in a lot of other rural places.  We have a lot of land that could yet be developed. There was a future for them here.\\\"\\nI asked Reese to help me meet the people whose lives have been impacted by GAStech's operations.  He introduced me to a farmer whose family had been here for several generations.  \\nI caught up with Henk Bodrogi in town making purchases at the Osvaldo hardware store to repair a broken tractor.  Bodrogi has farmed soybeans his entire life, as did his father and their fathers. I asked him about his life on the farm.\\nPart Two will be published April 25, 1998\"\n",

This forms part of its ambitions to expand its profitable business supplying gas outside of the Mediterranean region.\\n\\nIt is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past.\\nGAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe.\\n\\nGAStech does more than just pump gas. It has created towns and cities to service its operations, which it manages and runs almost single-handed.\\nThe head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the \\\"state within a state\\\" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them.\\n\\nOf course, people need good reasons to come and work in the hostile remote Kronosian regions.

In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area.\\nOne of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. As I remember it, a former trucker was in charge.\\nIt was a vivid example of how a once small exploration company from Thethys had begun to grow into a mighty international force in the energy industry.\\nBut I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it.\\nBut as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. From what's developed in the capital city there are important lessons for other places blessed (and cursed) with abundant natural resources.\\n\\\"Centrum developed world class expertise in engineering in very difficult surroundings\\\"\\n\\nWhen I was a young newspaperman on the Daily Record in Glasgow in the early 1970s, the great off-shore oil rush was beginning in the North Sea. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies.\\nIt seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry.\\nMuch to his mother's regrets, meanwhile, Sten Sanjorge had started prospecting in the early 1960s.\\n\\nBy the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances.\\nUnder his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield. It now has thousands employees and operates in numerous countries. \\n\\nThe change in Centrum has been substantial.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city.\\nAnd as you drive round Centrum, almost every roundabout is sponsored by a division of GAStech. \\n\\nSanjorge has recently started paying more attention to leisure activities and philanthropy, allowing his son Sten Jr. and co-founder Hank Fluss to run the company. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come.\\n\\nThe easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974. \\nSo thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.\"\n",

Investigators are awaiting toxicology reports to determine the cause of his death. Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to \\\"Cotton Candy\\\" according to the Kronos National Poison Center.\\n\\n\\nPatients are coming to Abila General from throughout the greater city region, and they include adults and youths, male and female, and all socio-economic backgrounds, Bianca said.\\n\\n\\nSgt Antonio Arresta of the Abila Fire Department, a first-responder to emergency medical calls in the city, said his department has also seen a spike in the number of people needing treatment for complications from designer drugs. \\\"We went from zero calls to a handful of calls\\\" in the last month,\\\" he said.\\nBianca and Arresta said their efforts to treat people is made more difficult because they often do not know anything about the designer drugs that were taken.\\n\\\"You don't know what you're getting when you get it,\\\" Bianca said. \\\"We have had patients come in and act out of control, who are very violent. They tell us they have been doing cotton candy or synthetic marijuana.\\\"\\nBianca said there is little clinical data on the effects of cotton candy, as it is an emerging toxicant. \\\"There are no controlled studies in toxicology,\\\" she said. The national poison center collects anecdotal reports on overdoses from hospitals and other providers as part of efforts to offer advice on how to treat patients.\\nDesigner drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. \\\"It is another way to sell it,\\\" she said.\\nThe term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat. The drug has been sold under the name of \\\"Spice Dreams\\\" one week and under the name of \\\"Tulip Blossom\\\" the next. \\nThe Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. The drugs are sold online as \\\"herbal therapy\\\" products and are available over the counter in area stores.\\n\\\"We still don't know what you are getting with cotton candy. The chemical composition varies from package to package,\\\" Bianca said.\\nOne factor for the popularity of cotton candy is its low cost, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166.\\n\\nCotton candy creates euphoria, or a high, that is equal to or greater than that of cocaine but also causes a crash that is worse, Bianca said. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. \\\"They crave it,\\\" she said.\\nAfter repeated use, the drug \\\"fries\\\" a person's brain, draining the chemicals that balance its operations. This sometimes leads to bizarre, often psychotic behavior that has been reported in the media, such as the case of the naked man in Elodis who was found running down the middle of a major highway, Bianca said. \\\"The seizures and delusions are incredible,\\\" she said.\\nWhile it is not yet certain who is behind the distribution of this round of designer drugs, police suspect organized crime is pursuing this large income source. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.\"\n",

But projects in Europe have been slow to take off, beset with opposition from government and local communities.\\nSanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited.\\n\\nMany environmentalists believe that hyper-acidic substrate removal can damage marine environments, and oppose the extraction of new fossil fuel resources. But drilling offshore avoids the need for difficult negotiations with local councils, communities and landholders.\\n\\nBased on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. There is also the possibility of finding oil.\\nGAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore.\\n\\n\\\"We're very comfortable that the resource is there and the numbers are absolutely ginormous,\\\" SanJorge said. \\\"Is any of that exploitable? That's the billion dollar question, and GAStech is wiling to invest in the answer.\\\"\\n\\nThough it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done.\\nProfessor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term.\\n\\n\\\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry. The task in the next 10 years is to try these things out, see if they work.\\\"\"\n",

The POK had gathered in memorialize their former leader, Elian Karel, who died of natural causes in jail last year.  POK supporters carried signs with pictures of Karel and Juliana Vann, chanted slogans, and lit candles. \\n\\nThe peaceful demonstration turned violent when two POK members accosted a man who attempted to enter the building on business.  The POK members hit him with a bottle, which knocked him to the ground and gave him a bloody gash on his forehead.  Abila police attempted to gain control of the situation by using bullhorns to call for the peaceful dispersal of the crowd, but the crowd responded to their calls by hurling insults along with a few rocks at the officers.  Police used tear gas to end the gathering, but a handful of die-hard POK members urged the crowd into melee with the officers.  Additional security forces had to be summoned to help contain the situation as the violence escalated.  When the tear gas finally cleared, six POK member were arrested on charges of assault on civil authorities and inciting a crowd to violence.  Three police officers were treated at Abila General Hospital for wounds received in the fight.\\n\\n\\\"We had been concerned that Silvia Marek's weak leadership is allowing the POK to be taken over by criminals and hooligans.

Citywide, several deaths have been attributed to \\\"Cotton Candy\\\" according to the Kronos National Poison Center. \\n\\nDesigner drugs are chemical compounds synthesized to resemble the active ingredient in often illegal drugs. Cotton candy mimics the drug khat, a stimulant. Manufacturers frequently change the designer drug's chemical composition and its name to stay one step ahead of authorities, Biance said. \\n\\nThe term cotton candy, for example, is a nickname of the drug and has nothing to do with the carnival treat.  \\n\\nThe Kronos government has placed three of the chemicals commonly used in the creation of cotton candy on its controlled substance list, criminalizing their use and possession. Still, the government cannot outright ban cotton candy because manufacturers can alter the recipe and skirt the law, Bianca said. She said a gram of cotton candy costs about K18 while a gram of cocaine costs K166. The crash's ill-effects often prompt people to binge on cotton candy to the point where they consume the drug for days. The Asterian People's Army has traditionally been involved with drug trafficking throughout the region, and enforcement agencies are closely examining possible cooperation between drug trafficking organizations and political insurgent groups.\"\n",

But not only who are they, what and why are they protesting? \\n\\nThe Protectors of Kronos or POK were founded in 1997 by residents of rural Elodis on the advice of the now defunct Wellness for All (WFA), an international water safety group. The POK was initiated to bring attention to the clean water issues surrounding Elodis to the Government of Kronos and the world. The POK asserts that GAStech International's Tiskele Bend natural gas drilling site is the source of both the contamination of drinking water as well as the destruction of the traditional farmland surrounding Elodis. \\n\\nIn 1998, WFA performed testing on the water of Elodis finding high levels of benzene, toluene and xylene arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and selenium. The testing a subsequent statement released by WFA brought international attention and pressure on the government and GAStech to act. However, with the fragmenting of WFA due to funding issues, the POK's demands were largely ignored and downplayed. \\n\\nAlso in 1998, Juliana Vann, a previously healthy ten-year old girl died of a lingering illness, which WFA-funded doctors claimed was caused by water contamination. The Government of Kronos officially refuted the claim citing the fragmentation of the WFA organization as evidence of an unreliable source not to be trusted. Regardless, Juliana became the POK's first martyr and has used Juliana's image on campaign literature ever since. \\n\\nThe POK's second major martyr is Elian Karel, who died in 2009 while incarcerated of undetermined causes. The POK asserts he was arrested on trumped up charges while the Government of Kronos contends he was a radical and violent activist engaged in tax evasion. Karel had been involved with the POK since its inception given that his father, Jeroen Karel, was an original member.  Elian Karel's death in 2009 was marked by spontaneous instances of protest around Abila. The anniversary of his death, June 19, has seen additional protests, demonstrations, riots, and violence. \\n\\nThe POK has evolved from peaceful protests and demonstrations demanding government action to more violent activities including riots as they claim that the government has done little to nothing in addressing the contamination, poisonings, and deaths suffered by their people. As of 2011, the Government of Kronos has labeled the POK as a \\\"public threat\\\".\"\n",

It is succeed much today more with difficulty. Foreign need CEOs their minimize expectations. There are easily none wins in Kronos. The competition under Kronosian and foreign firms is tough. It is difficult the harten and win the opinions of the population.\\n\\nBut there is less difference than people between culture Kronosian think and, culture says Tethian. The staff work of Kronos like only hard, is they respectful of their work and has same the wish for success.

[Think] after memoranda. Foreign CEOs have been always confused and frustrated when they send a memorandum [to someone in Kronos] and simple yes/no expect answer. In place of it they become a very long answer to that their initial question does not answer.\\n\\nPeople of Kronos love the no responsibility to take. They are do be scared to lose their job and do not love in saying something are forced they to wants.

Are able round to be easily taken for granted and cannot do cre\\u00ebrt this a large meaning of uncertainty. In Kronos are you never certainly as your driver you on the planned address sale. This is possible if a small question seems but on a daily basis it is very tiring.\\n\\nAnother get to know your team and which you work with. Frequently foreign CEOs right to walk of the plane and in an office peak of employees Kronos. They have no idea that they are, how they work or how qualified they are. This can be confusing. \\n\\nThe need of CEOs demand the time to speak for their staff, of the administrators for the truck drivers and their new environment to understand before they try and them lead.\\n\\nQ: Can you give a couple ends on how foreign CEO can preparations make?\\n\\nA: The first thing which I am your prepare family would say. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new work surroundings. This can influence it personal life. Mixing family and the work is here very common practice. People of Kronos work overtime and socializing with their colleagues it is very differing from Tethys where there is a clear border between the work and family.\\n\\nForeign CEOs also must realize how tough are the competition and how much hard work must be introduced to succeed -- frequently much more than in their birth country. The language is a large question.\\n\\n[But] no question how much you prepare, real experience will surprise in Kronos to work and live you always.\\n\\nQ: How difficult - or easy - is it for foreign CEO in Kronos to be?\\n\\nA: Generally, think I am CEO hard am. There is a lot very, is the environment tough and it is difficult find a balance with your personal life.\\n\\nWhen a team hears Kronos that CEO come assume from overseas she is it a problem. But culturally they have no question with aliens. \\n\\nQ: There are situations in which it are a foreign staff employee in fact an advantage is?\\n\\nA: This question depends really on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and culture. If they make no effort then to localize is it a net disadvantage. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as luxury goods, foreign CEOs can be an advantage. They can bring to a another view, the process to facilitate.\\n\\nSometimes foreign CEO better knowledge of the industry have and can access to markets overseas bring. This can be real assets.\"\n",

However, it has humble beginnings as a gas and oil prospector in Tethys. \\n\\nIt spoke at times about the features about a chief successful in Kronos and which foreign Presidents can envisage in the market. \\n\\nQ: What the foreign Presidents can they wait when they come in Kronos?\\n\\nA: the economic environment changed since the Eighties. It is much more difficult to succeed today. The foreign Presidents must play in bottom of their hopes. There is no easy victory in Kronos. Competition among Kronosian and foreign companies is hard. It is difficult to gain the hearts and the spirits of the population.\\n\\nBut there is less of difference than people think between the culture of Kronosian and, culture of Tethian of word. The personnel of Kronos function just like hard, they are respectful of their work and have the same desire for success. They can also appreciate the effective communication and a gifted chief.\\n\\nWhich foreign chief must make is to learn how to communicate the \\\"manner of Kronosian\\\" and to take time to include/understand their personnel.\\n\\nQ: Can you work out?\\n\\nA: There are many cultural differences while communicating. [To consider] notes. The foreign Presidents are always confused and frustrated when they send a note [with somebody in Kronos] and expect a simple response of yes/No Instead of that they obtain a very long answer which does not answer their initial question.\\n\\nThe people of Kronos do not like to take the responsability. They are frightened to lose their work and do not like to be forced in saying something which they do not want with. The foreign Presidents must take account of this and have to take time to include/understand how to communicate.\\n\\nPatience is key. Transparency can be an excellent manner of coming to end this. It is a European value which Kronosians are very sensitive to. To impose on a company can transform with the voyage of a foreign President into Kronos an experiment much more pleasant.\\n\\nQ: What the challenges of force are they a foreign PRESIDENT can they face on the arrival in Kronos?\\n\\n\\n\\nA: Sometimes in fact the simplest things can be most provocative, like going from A with B in a taxi. To be able to travel around easily is taken for granted and not being able to make thus creates a great direction of the insecurity. In Kronos you are never sure if your driver drops to you to far with the address envisaged. This can seem as a small question but daily it is very tiring.\\n\\nAnother ends up knowing your team and with which you work. Just often foreign of stage of Presidents in addition to plane and in an office completely of the colleagues of Kronos. They do not have any idea which they are, how they work or as they qualified are. This can be muddling. \\n\\nThe Presidents must take time to speak with their personnel, of the administrators to the drivers of truck and to include/understand their new environment before they test them and control.\\n\\nQ: Can you give some ends on the way in which a foreign PRESIDENT can prepare?\\n\\nA: the first thing that I would say is to prepare your family. They can find it difficult to adapt to the new environment of operation. This can affect the personal life. The family and the work of mixture are practical very current here. The people of Kronos work of overtime and socializes with their colleagues. It is very different from Tethys where there is a clear border between work and the family.\\n\\nThe foreign Presidents should also carry out how hard competition is and how much hard work must be put inside to succeed -- often much more than in their countries of origin. The language is a great question.\\n\\n[But] anyhow much prepare you, the true experiment to work and to live in Kronos will always astonish you.\\n\\nQ: How much difficult - or easy - is it to be a foreign PRESIDENT in Kronos?\\n\\nA: Generally, I think that being a PRESIDENT is hard. There is much pressure, the environment is hard and it is difficult to find a balance with your personal life.\\n\\nWhen a team of Kronos hears them that a PRESIDENT comes from overseas suppose it is a problem. But, culturally they do not have a question with foreigners. \\n\\nQ: Are there situations in which to be a foreign director is really an advantage?\\n\\nA: This question really depends on the person and how much they invest to understand the country and the culture. If they do not make any effort locate then it is a Net handicap. But in certain negotiations or certain questions such as the goods of luxury, the foreign Presidents can be an advantage. They can bring another point of view, facilitate the process.\\n\\nSometimes the foreign PRESIDENT with the best knowledge of an industry and can bring the access to the markets of overseas.

In the past it has had a reputation as corrupt and environmentally harmful, but nowadays GAStech, the former Tethys-only business, is trying to earn the trust of international investors. \\n\\nIt is an uphill task, and there is no certainty that Gastech has the ability to convince potential investors it has mended its ways, and is no longer rooted in the eco-hostile past. \\n\\nGAStech's pipeline operations are based in eastern Kronos, and there is close relationship with the Kronosian government. This is the heart of Kronos's pipeline business, where gas from the eastern gas fields is piped west towards the rest of Kronos, Tethys and Europe. \\n\\nGAStech does more than just pump gas. \\n\\nThe head of GAStech, Sten Sanjorge, Jr, whose photo stares out from calendars and picture frames everywhere in the country, acknowledges the \\\"state within a state\\\" accusations, but argues that the company simply needs to look after its workers and the communities around them. The GAStech empire owns 2 thousand cows and 3 thousand pigs in its company farms, runs gyms, and offers subsidised holidays in Black Sea resorts for key employees. There is an argument, however, that the energy business is different from other industries, requiring energy corporations to operate in distinct ways. \\n\\nWorking in far-off places with no previous infrastructure means oil and gas sites will always be, to some extent, company towns. GAStech certainly strives to ensure its employees can move in and out of these locations by operating a private fleet of four planes to ferry its staff the huge distances between sites.\"\n",

Exploration has proved a controversial issue in Kronos>> \\n\\nContinue reading the main story  \\n\\nThe son of the founder of gas firm GAStech is planning a venture to drill in the Mediterranean Sea, the Times has learned. He believes there are large volumes of offshore gas that could be extracted. \\n\\n\\\"Certainly offshore gas isn't a new concept, but there's no reason with the Kronosian history of offshore development that we can't develop these resources offshore,\\\" he told the Times. \\n\\nShale gas is extracted using the controversial technique of hyper-acidic substrate removal which involves injecting acidic chemicals shale layers, to break them up and release the natural gas trapped within. \\n\\nHyper-acidic substrate removal has produced vast quantities of gas and oil in the West, transforming the energy market. \\n\\nSanjorge says it will be a short time before we know if offshore shale gas can be exploited. \\n\\nBased on existing geological data, SanJorge believes that a considerable quantity of gas is in place - up to 100 trillion cubic feet, which would be more than GAStech's estimates for its onshore resources. \\n\\nGAStech has estimated that the Kronos total offshore shale gas resources could be between five and 10 times the size of the resources available onshore. \\n\\nThough it has only recently become controversial, hyper-acidic substrate removal has been used on a smaller scale for many years, to improve the flow from conventional oil and gas wells. But using the process on the large numbers of wells needed to extract offshore shale gas commercially has never been done. \\n\\nProfessor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University is sceptical about whether offshore shale gas could be a big contributor to European energy in the next decade, but says that it could have potential in the longer term. \\n\\n\\\"GAStech is being optimistic is its estimates of how long it will take to explore offshore shale. It's perfectly plausible that in 20, 30 or 40 years, the hyper-acidic substrate removal technology will have so advanced and the way in which we deal with the offshore environment will have so advanced that this could be a really big industry.\"\n",

In Tethys a few years ago, I journeyed laboriously to the remote gas fields of Tethys to look at a contentious new energy producing area. \\n\\nOne of the sites I visited was a local office of the Sanjorge Gas company, crammed with reinforced work boots and overalls and the chemicals and supplies you need to run a gas operation. \\n\\nBut I'd forgotten about the encounter until I went back to Tethys the other day for the first time since their early years, to reacquaint with the man who created the business, Sten Sanjorge: one man (one of the richest individuals in Tethys) who has lived through the whole story of gas prospecting and prospered mightily from it. \\n\\nBut as I went round the capital city of Centrum interviewing people, I soon realised that this was not just a story of new energy. Something very significant has happened to turn Centrum into a global centre of gas industry expertise. It then seemed a pretty impossible dream, turning an island of coal into a place with abundant oil and gas supplies. \\n\\nIt seemed to us on the west coast of Scotland that the far flung city of Centrum, Tethys was getting a bit big for its boots, starting to believe in a new fantasy industry. \\n\\nBy the early 1970s, a new gas company, GAStech, began its juggernaut-like advances. \\n\\nUnder his canny guidance, GAStech evolved into a major supplier of natural gas to the local region, and then much further afield.  You notice them in the constant clutter of helicopters to-ing and fro-ing out to remote areas, and the planes lined up at the city's airport to shuttle execs back and forth from the city. But Sanjorge has just been asked to produce a report for the Tethan government recommending the best ways of ensuring that Tethys continues to produce energy for decades to come. \\n\\nThe easy-to-get stuff has been produced, so keeping the gas coming will need much investment and more clever new techniques, such as the hyper-acidic substrate removal techniques developed by the company in 1974.  \\n\\nSo thanks to clever people such as Sten Sanjorge and the people who work with him, Centrum has achieved what every place where raw materials are discovered longs to do. The city has taken the temporary boon of energy on its doorstep, and turned it into specialized knowledge and intellectual property which may make Centrum a centre of gas expertise long after the gas itself runs out.\"\n",
