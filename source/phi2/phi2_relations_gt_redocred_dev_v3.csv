303," French Resistance | fought against | Nazi German occupation of France and against the collaborationist Vichy rgime during the Second World War
French Resistance | played a significant role in facilitating the Allies'rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, and the lesser-known invasion of Provence on 15 August, by providing military intelligence on the German defences known as the Atlantic Wall and on Wehrmacht deployments and orders of battle.
French Resistance | provided the country with an inspiring example of the patriotic fulfillment of a national imperative, countering an existential threat to French nationhood.
French Resistance | stood in marked contrast to the collaboration of the French regime based at Vichy, the French people who joined the pro-Nazi Milice franaise and the French men who joined the Waffen SS.
French Resistance | was politically and morally important to France, both during the German occupation and for decades afterward, because it provided the country with an inspiring example of the patriotic fulfillment of a national imperative, countering an existential threat to French nationhood.
French Resistance | was estimated to have a strength of 100,000 in June 1944, and grew rapidly to approximately 400,000 by October of that year.
French Resistance | was organised more formally, into a hierarchy of operational units known, collectively, as the French Forces of the Interior (FFI).
