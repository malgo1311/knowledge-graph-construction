Text: The first known use of the word ""lunula"" was in the Latin text of Plautus' play, Epidicus. The word is derived from the Latin word lunula, which means ""little moon"". The lunula was a crescent moon-shaped pendant that was worn by girls in ancient Rome. It was believed to have protective powers and was often worn as an apotropaic amulet. The word ""lunula"" is also used in the English language to refer to the crescent moon shape of the pendant.
