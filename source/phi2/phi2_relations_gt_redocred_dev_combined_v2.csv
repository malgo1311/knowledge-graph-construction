Text: The first known use of the word ""lunula"" was in the Latin text of Plautus' play, Epidicus. The word is derived from the Latin word lunula, which means ""little moon"". The lunula was a crescent moon-shaped pendant that was worn by girls in ancient Rome. It was believed to have protective powers and was often worn as an apotropaic amulet. The word ""lunula"" is also used in the English language to refer to the crescent moon shape of the pendant.

French Resistance | played a significant role in facilitating the Allies'rapid advance through France following the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, and the lesser-known invasion of Provence on 15 August, by providing military intelligence on the German defences known as the Atlantic Wall and on Wehrmacht deployments and orders of battle.
French Resistance | provided the country with an inspiring example of the patriotic fulfillment of a national imperative, countering an existential threat to French nationhood.
French Resistance | stood in marked contrast to the collaboration of the French regime based at Vichy, the French people who joined the pro-Nazi Milice franaise and the French men who joined the Waffen SS.
French Resistance | was politically and morally important to France, both during the German occupation and for decades afterward, because it provided the country with an inspiring example of the patriotic fulfillment of a national imperative, countering an existential threat to French nationhood.
French Resistance | was estimated to have a strength of 100,000 in June 1944, and grew rapidly to approximately 400,000 by October of that year.
French Resistance | was organised more formally, into a hierarchy of operational units known, collectively, as the French Forces of the Interior (FFI).
