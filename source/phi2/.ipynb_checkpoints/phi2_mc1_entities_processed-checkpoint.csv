Assistant: The text discusses the potential of the shale gas industry in Europe and the opinions of Professor Oskar Wertz of Tethys University and GAStech. Professor Wertz is skeptical about the industry's growth in the next decade but acknowledges its potential in the longer term. GAStech is optimistic about the industry's future and believes that with advancements in technology, it could become a large industry in 20, 30, or 40 years.
